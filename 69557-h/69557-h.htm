<h3>WHY THIS DEFINITION IS ATTEMPTED</h3>


<p>What social worker has not been asked to define social
work and found himself at a loss? It is easy to describe his
own particular tasks but it is not easy to characterize the
profession as a whole or to say why its very diverse phases
are identified with one another. Why should we apply the
term “social work” to hospital social service and probation,
but not to nursing and interpreting, services which seem
to stand in a similar relation to medicine and the courts?</p>

<p>Definitions of social work are not yet to be found in dictionaries
or encyclopedias. A certain amount of characterization
appears in current literature, by implication or by
mention of one feature here and another there. Some general
descriptions say of it things which, though true, do not distinguish
it.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Probably no strict definition is possible. The
field of social work is constantly extending; its functions
are multiplying by geometric progression; its means are
undergoing continuous adaptation and in all its phases it
shades off into other kinds of work or attracts allied work
to its own likeness. The inconvenience of this state of
affairs is a constant subject of complaint and for at least
three reasons we badly need some sort of definition.</p>

<p>In the first place whenever we talk without first agreeing
on the meaning of terms we are wasting time and giving
unnecessary opportunity for bad blood. The term “social
work” is now used in several entirely different senses. One
man, in using it, is referring to a characteristic technique,
which to him is its distinguishing feature, such, for instance,
as social case work; another is thinking of a certain function
in social economy, for instance, the relief of distress; a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>third is designating a policy in social reform, a temporizing
policy, for example. So long as this latitude of use continues
we will talk at cross purposes whether in discussion
of specific ways and means or in the evaluation of social
work as a factor in human affairs. Any definition would
make it easier for us to agree or explicitly disagree on what
we mean by social work.</p>

<p>In the second place while the nature and purpose of a
calling are perceived cloudily or not at all it does not manifest
the coherence and momentum which inspire constructive
work. Its followers are in danger of floundering among
isolated tasks or finding their sense of continuity and purpose
in the mere observation of correct procedure. Social
work while feeling an implicit affinity in its many forms,
often seems to suffer from lack of any essential principles
or any demonstrable obligation or responsibility, other than
those incumbent on the community as a whole. The process
of definition offers a means of bringing to light any principles
or responsibilities especially pertaining to it.</p>

<p>Thirdly social work now suffers unnecessarily in reputation
and support (even among its own practitioners) for disappointing
demands which would never have been made were
its nature better understood. Every undertaking has its
limitations and when known and understood they constitute
no reproach. But the preoccupations and aspirations of
social work are such as to tempt its proponents to enlarge
on infinite possibilities, forgetting in their enthusiasm to
state that these possibilities can only be realized if the ministrations
and advices of social work are accepted in many
places where it has no enforceable influence. The limits set
to any single line of human endeavor working by itself are
very narrow, and for social work, as for other things, they
are in practice promptly reached. Social work when it
stands thus at the end of its powers seems to have betrayed
the confidence placed in it. A limiting definition would show
that the fault lies not in social work but in unreasonable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
expectations. Such a definition would be its best defense
from antagonistic critics and disappointed followers.</p>

<p>Yet “social work” in spite of all uncertainty does stand
for something real. Annually there meets a National Conference
of Social Work with 2637 individual and group memberships
representing 46 States, the District of Columbia,
Cuba, Hawaii, the Philippines and Canada and 6 foreign
countries.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There has lately been formed an American Association
of Social Workers<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> composed of master workmen in
its several lines, who must qualify in terms of preparation
or experience and who are associated for the purpose of
maintaining a high standard of work. All this indicates
that there is a general concept of social work, and if there
is such a thing it must be amenable to some sort of description
or analysis. Though water-tight definition seems impossible
it is frequently not necessary. If any characteristics
can be found which appear in all the forms of social
work and not in activities unrelated to it they will at least
serve the three practical purposes for which definition is
so urgently needed.</p>

<p>Materials for analysis are not wanting. Social work has
had its national conference for fifty years, its magazine for
thirty-six<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and its schools for twenty-five<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and the conference
reports, the magazines and the school curricula constitute
a competent body of evidence that can be consulted
either in cross section or in chronological perspective. If we
forego expectation of a precise and all-mentioning definition
and adjust our demands to the practicabilities of the case
we may hopefully challenge these compact sources of information,
together with the dispersed literature of the subject,
with observation and experience to stand and deliver a
working definition.</p>

<h3>THE CHARITABLE ELEMENT IN SOCIAL WORK</h3>


<p>The “charities directories” of New York<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and Philadelphia<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
offer the most inclusive available lists of the various
types of social work. For present purposes it will be sufficient
to review them by groups. Duplications, omissions,
and extraneous inclusions (all legitimate for the purposes
of the directories) make the figures of agencies of each type
inaccurate but they serve to show the multiplicity as well
as the range of social work undertakings.</p>

<p>In cross section no obvious, no easily discernible bond
appears among these diverse agencies. An eleemosynary
purpose, the first suggestion of most laymen, is indignantly
repudiated by the modern social worker and can be, in many
cases, categorically disproved. All are benevolent, but so
also are educational, religious, artistic and other undertakings
not commonly considered social work.</p>

<p>It is a standing rule of science that if you can see nothing
crosswise you must try squinting lengthwise. If a present
form will not answer your questions look back along its
history and consider its origin—study its evolution and
genetics. Such a policy with respect to social work brings
us promptly to a strong clue.</p>

<p>The interests of social work have wandered far from
those of old-fashioned charity and “mere charity” has now
a bad name, but we of this generation knew social work before
it came of age and when we hear it repudiating charity
we recognize the act of a thankless child denying an unfashionable
parent. The oldest of the schools was called
until 1919 the “New York School of <i>Philanthropy</i>” and the
same word appeared in the names of the Chicago school and
others. The “Survey,” the accepted general organ of the
profession (if it is a profession), was until 1905 published
as “Charities” and for three years more as “Charities and
the Commons.” What is now the “National Conference of
Social Work” was organized as the “Conference of Charities
and Corrections” and kept that title right down to 1917.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>We may therefore push our investigation back a step
farther and for the question “what is social work?” substitute
the less difficult inquiries “what was charity and by
what modifications did social work develop from it?” However
far apart these two may at present seem it is a patent
fact that social work developed from charity and along the
route of that development there is hope of enlightenment as
to the essential nature of social work.</p>

<p>Charity in one sense is the name of a human quality—that
which “suffereth long and is kind.” With this sense of the
word the present inquiry is not concerned but with a more
completely objective meaning. The dictionaries give it as
“benevolence, liberality in relieving the wants of others,
philanthropy,”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or “liberality to the poor, to benevolent institutions
or worthy causes.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The wording varies little.
Philanthropy where it is described any differently from
charity is merely a broader term not confined to the succor
of the especially unfortunate, as “love of mankind especially
as evinced in deeds of practical beneficence.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>If we look at this “charity” in action we find its performance
to be directed to the same ends even though we
follow it back through two millenniums of Christianity and
Paganism.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Motive and policy vary, but the tasks of charity
are recrudescent and impose themselves on each successive
generation in terms of the contemporary conscience. We
seem, for example, to have forgotten the question which
haunted sixteenth century motivation—whether faith without
works avails for salvation, but we might still subscribe
to a contemporaneous plan of action which demanded “the
suppression of vagrant beggars, the punishment of impostors”
and “a rational organization of benefits under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>control of the municipal authorities.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The <i>task</i> is still
with us.</p>

<p>This so adaptable and so perdurable “charity,” while constantly
changing its terms remains always in essence a
free will offering made to those who are in some fashion
especially in need. It may consist of material benefits or of
services. An authoritative historian of English philanthropy
says in his nearest approach to a definition that “Philanthropy,
in common with other terms in general use, is difficult,
or more probably incapable of strict definition. We
may perhaps safely say that it proceeds from the free will
of the agent, and not in response to any claim of legal right
on the part of the recipient.” “The greater part of philanthropy
may be said to consist in contributions of money,
service or thought, such as the recipient has no strict claim
to demand and the donor is not compelled to render.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Does this characterization hold good in our own country
and time? First, must the gift be free? Where a service
is exacted by law do we ever consider it charity? Free education
while supported by voluntary contribution was considered
a form of charity but when it came to be supported
by taxes its connection with charity lapsed and was forgotten.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The upkeep of highways and bridges has been an
object of charitable bequest—a benefit which the fortunate
might out of his abundance bestow upon his neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The establishment of public responsibility for the
highways has lifted this sort of benevolence from the category
of charity. Prisoners whose support was not provided
for by their own means or the concern of friends were for
long dependent upon charity.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> A nicer sense of corporate
responsibility now requiring them to be fed at the public
charge we see no charity in their support but when private
interest carries into the prisons influences presumably improving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>and meets friendless prisoners at the jail gate we
recognize the unforced ministrations of charity removed to
another field. We still stand near the turn of the road
in the matter of caring for workmen injured during their
work. A little while ago any provision by the employer for
the injured man or his family was regarded as an act of
charity. Latterly we have come to consider it no more
than right that an industrial establishment should share
the burden, as it does the fault, of such accidents, and state
after state has enacted laws compelling “compensation.”
And as relief of the injured man and his family has thus
been made compulsory on the establishment in which he
works it has ceased to be charitable. The act remains the
same but with the loss of spontaneity its charitable quality
has disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>It is true that we have a very considerable development of
so-called “public charities.” But are not the services they
render offered through the body politic merely to secure a
certainty and inclusiveness of relief for which we dare not
rely on private benevolence? And do we not continue to call
them “charity” precisely because we still regard them as a
free gift rather than as a routine purveyance which the
state is essentially committed to provide? Some of them are
plainly in process of transition and here and there we find
the almshouse becoming the “county hospital,” or the department
of public charities the “welfare department,” the
nomenclature following a change in the conception of
function.</p>

<p>If, furthermore, we examine the public attitude toward
those undertakings which we have cited as having graduated
from charity into public purveyance, we will recognize that
these are considered public responsibilities in a different
sense from any which so far attaches to what we still call
public charities. Public education is held to be a natural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>prerequisite of democracy; the making of roads a thing
contributing impartially to the universal convenience; the
feeding of prisoners the inescapable responsibility of those
who have cut them off from the means of making a livelihood.</p>

<p>Moreover we make certain doles which we explicitly insist
are not to be counted “charity”—pensions given after military
or government service or to widows rearing children
for the commonwealth—and in disassociating them from
charity it is the custom to point out that they are not concessions
but just deserts, something that can be claimed as
a right.</p>

<p>Charity then is a free gift. It need not be given in love, as
its etymology would assume, indeed it may be given in a
mood of revulsion, in the hope of expiating a sin or in mere
fear of the indignation of the deprived. The recording
angel probably keeps a record of the motive and the spirit,
but charity, in its simple objective meaning on men’s lips,
inheres in the act of relief.</p>

<p>The brief characterization of philanthropy which we are
testing was two-fold. It declared philanthropy to be a free
gift and a gift to need. Just as the one qualification of the
act was that it must be in no way exacted so the one qualification
of the recipient was that his candidacy must consist
only in need. Does this also hold true in our own country
and our own time? Surely it is plain beyond any call for
proof that only that is charity which is bestowed where need
appoints the recipient. Free gifts are made to the prosperous,
there is mutual helpfulness among equals, there are
services prompted by loyalty and personal affection, but
these, though unforced, are not called charity. But it will not
do to dwell too much on the negative implications of “need,”
on deprivation or suffering. We might almost avoid that
rather misleading word and say that a gift is charity only
when the outstanding circumstance is occasion for it. But
it is a familiar observation that ardors or privations which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
are accepted as the order of life while we see no prospect
of remedy become conscious hardships at the mere rumor of
succor and so it necessarily happens that the very act of
service or relief prompted only by its own fitness is the
creator of an ex-post-facto need even where the situation
previously scarcely merited so strong a name.</p>

<p>Charity is not, however, preoccupied with material need
only or with physical suffering or any other one phase of
life. Moral redemption, intellectual opportunity, artistic
realization—these also have come within its purview. It
may follow mortal man into his every predicament and
minister to his hungers of whatever sort. Only if we keep
this well in mind will we be justified in associating it with
so negative a term as need. It is the unconscious champion
of the perfectibility of man. “The normal life,” “our common
inheritance,” “humanity in whatever form,” “the rights
of the humblest individual”—these are its commonplaces
that have lost significance from frequent and often perfunctory
repetition. But the fact that they are the commonplaces
of the subject is in itself significant. The commonplaces
of all subjects are not of that sort.</p>

<p>These then are the essentials of charity “a free gift and
a gift to need.” May we go on to inquire what additions
or alterations have developed these into social work, or is
social work a thing so far transmuted from charity that it
no longer shows the very elements of its original? A reperusal
of our digest of the charities directories shows the
many forms of social work all of them still to include the
qualities of charity. In the first place the services of social
work are still a gift. Sometimes they are provided by the
state in close association with the obligatory work of some
routine state department, but in such cases the tasks of
social workers will be found to differ from those of the other
employees in the department in being not only highly extensible
and almost infinitely variable but in some degree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
supererogatory—as in the case of the follow-up work of the
workmen’s compensation office.</p>

<p>In the second place the presence of a need, though less
evident among the forms of social work than in the case of
primitive charity, is always discernible. Social work often
seems to aspire to knowledge rather than accomplishment,
as when making investigations or surveys or when any form
of ministration is accompanied by so much solicitation of
information as to raise the question of which is product
and which by-product. But its activities will always on inspection
be found to claim connection with the discovery
and removal of some form of human ill. Social work itself
naturally points to immediate purposes, small definitive tasks
like the formulation of a standard distribution of expenses
in the budget of a family at subsistence level. To conclude
that these are its ultimate objects would be as serious a
mistake as to imagine that the medical profession would rest
satisfied with a set of dependable prognoses. And these
investigations do not exploit the fields of prosperity. They
consistently maintain a preoccupation with untoward conditions
and a sense of stewardship. Before all social work, as
surely as before charity, a Samaritan purpose floats like
a will-o-the-wisp, an inconstant and shifting but ever discernible
guide, sometimes at several removes from the work
in hand but always its ultimate sanction.</p>

<p>Social work then, incorporates, while it modifies, charity,
and we find ourselves ready to discuss the second part of
our question—what is the nature of these modifications
which have produced social work?</p>

<h3>THE SCIENTIFIC ELEMENT IN SOCIAL WORK</h3>


<p>The historical perspective which shows social work to have
developed out of charity shows also that there is a close
relation between that development and contemporaneous developments
in other lines. We know that in every field of
production, trade and business, enterprising men have lately
developed practical sciences to replace the old rules of thumb,
and that even in such a field as teaching there has lately
appeared a derived science of pedagogy which levies on
psychology and other direct sciences for its material. The
stewards of charity, like other people, saw the light of
science full on their path. The result was a new hope. Again
and again in statements like the following we have been told
that the grosser disabilities which charity relieved could be
done away with for good if we would systematically search
out and treat their causes. “Poverty, vice and crime are no
more impossible to stamp out from human society than
small-pox and measles. To do the one requires the same
intelligence on the part of man, though perhaps in a higher
degree, that the other does. The social sciences and arts
should have the same expansion as all the other sciences
and arts combined in that the relations of men to each
other are equally important if not more important than the
relations of man to nature.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Or again, “The most formidable
obstacle to the adoption of the policy of prevention
and treatment is not resistance to the necessary public expenditure,
still less inability to raise the money, but the
lack of administrative science and the shortcomings of our
administrative machinery. Merely to relieve destitution has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>been nearly as easy as to do nothing. But successfully to
intervene in order to prevent—whether to prevent sickness,
to prevent the neglect of children, to prevent the multiplication
of the mentally unfit, or to prevent unemployment—involves
the discovery of causes, the formation of large
schemes of policy, the purposeful planning of collective action
in modifying the environment of the poorer classes, together
with scientifically diversified treatment of those individuals
who fall below the recognized standards of civilized life.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>When charity had thus accepted the necessity of using
scientific methods there ensued immediate and far-reaching
results. Chief of these have been the three developments
which transformed charity into social work. It is possible
to trace them in performance and to trace a parallel development
of philosophy in the literature of the subject. These
developments can be simply indicated as (1) a systematization
of service; (2) an interest in causes of disaster, and
(3) an extension of charitable interest into new fields.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>


<h4>THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF SERVICE</h4>

<p>The converts to a scientific method undertook to work
within the traditional field of charity with a new thoroughness
and system.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Fired with the belief of their times in
a tenable norm of prosperity and a continuous progress dependent
only on scientific control of our environment they
naturally hoped that the most stubborn situation could be
harmonized with the general melioration by the use of appropriate
methods and they were no longer content to offer
only relief, work, care for the helpless and such simple services
as were once all that was thought of. They constantly
challenged the applicability of old palliative expedients and
looked for reconstructive measures. “For every one thing,”
writes Miss Richmond, “that could then (1832) be done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>about a man’s attitude toward his life and his social relations,
about his health, housing, work and recreation, there
are now (1917) a dozen things to do. The power to analyze
a human situation closely as distinguished from the old
method of falling back upon a few general classifications,
grows with the consciousness of the power to get things
done.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This change in expectation may be seen in the
nomenclature of the tasks which social work has set itself.
At first “relief” was the objective, then “<i>adequate</i> relief”
and now it is “rehabilitation.” The methods were, first the
alternatives “relief” or “corrective treatment,” for there
were sheep and goats in those days, then “preventive treatment”
and now “adjustment.”</p>

<p>Rehabilitation and adjustment are far more delicate and
responsible matters than mere relief or even “preventive
treatment” and we find social workers warning each other
that “life cannot be administered by definite rules and regulations
and that wisdom to deal with a man’s difficulties
comes only through some knowledge of his life and habits
as a whole and that to treat a separate episode is almost
sure to invite blundering.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The excuse for quoting so obvious
a statement is that former practice actually required
it to be made. Philanthropy took little cognizance of its supposed
beneficiaries’ “life and habits as a whole.” Such a feat
of synthetic judgment cannot of course be more than
roughly approximated. It has, however, proved possible to
develop a technique of inquiry, analysis, interpretation and
direct or indirect remedial action which is known as social
case work and can be made the subject of systematic instruction
in the schools for training social workers. And
within the last six years has come Miss Richmond’s
book with the suggestive title, “Social Diagnosis,” to
give a description of simple charity availing itself of
the means suggested by an age of scientific experiment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>and so justifying the expression, “scientific charity,”
which, unexplained, sounds so incongruous. The method
of social case work is sometimes claimed to be the
essential and distinguishing feature of social work but
if we study the classic expositions of case work we find
that they are describing on their own showing a <i>method</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and a method which though applicable to many types of
social work is not applicable to all and which is, moreover, by
no means confined to social work. Case work, in any
connection, is the systematic study of all considerable effects
and causes in a particular situation and the development and
application of special means to alter that situation in some
preferred direction. Social case work is simply case work
in the form it takes when applied in social work. There are
some fully accepted forms of social work which have no
occasion to use it. Important as it is we must recognize
it as an expedient and not social work per se.</p>


<h4>THE INTEREST IN CAUSES</h4>

<p>An interest in the causes of disaster is responsible for the
development of those forms of social work which do not retain
the immediate serviceableness of charity proper. It
has developed as part of the already described attempt to
systematize philanthropic service and also on an independent
line of its own. “In practically all departments of the work
of prevention” write the Webbs, “in the campaign against
degeneration and in favor of promotion of better breeding;
in the campaign against the ruin of adolescence, the creation
of unemployment and the demoralization of the unemployed—we
are always being stopped by the need for further
experience and additional research. We know enough now
to know how extremely important it is to increase our
knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>This need of more knowledge after every step before the
next can be taken, this constant challenge offered by our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>uncharted social life has caused the development of an interest
in observation and investigation independent of any
direct errands of mercy. Many known abuses exist which
are sure to claim their victims from time to time and a certain
amount of social work takes the form of an independent
crusade against such abuses. This type of social work often
embarks on a search for causes of trouble which proves
endless and indistinguishable from the search for knowledge.
A great deal of social work is now of this sort—the studies
of the Russell Sage Foundation and the lesser local foundations
for research and prevention, the original “Pittsburgh
Survey” and all those that have followed it, the careful
neighborhood studies of the settlements from the “Hull
House Maps and Papers” on and the intensive group studies,
studies, comparative statistics and stock takings of uncounted
miscellaneous agencies. Inquiry bids fair to be as
common in social work as ever alms was in charity.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>


<h4>THE EXTENSION OF THE PHILANTHROPIC INTEREST</h4>

<p>The extension of a philanthropic interest into new fields,
the third result of scientific thoroughness and system has,
bewildered us and occasioned most of the inquiry as to what
social work may be. Today in the administrative departments
of Federal and State governments, in the churches,
the courts, the schools, the hospitals there is work being
done which has a double allegiance. On the one hand it
is responsible to government, religion, law, education or
public health, as the case may be, and on the other it is all
alike responsible to social work.</p>

<p>The persons who engage in this work are as much social
workers as those in any traditionally philanthropic field and
have simply followed persons whom they are trying to help
into situations which philanthropy did not formerly consider
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>to be its business. Philanthropy has long taken an interest
in jails and reform schools, it has only quite recently followed
into court anyone still unconvicted. This it does in the
case of children and is beginning to do for some classes
of adults. The social worker of the adult court is the probation
officer, a representative of voluntary chivalry toward
the defendant, standing in the very stronghold of implacable
justice. The contrast between the points of view of criminal
law and social work is clearly put by a judge in describing
the function of the juvenile court. “The inquiry (in the
juvenile court) is not to determine whether the child is a
criminal or not, but to determine its status in relationship
to its need of the care and protection of the state. Being
adjudged in need of such special care the state assumes its
guardianship and oversight, always for the welfare of the
child. The aims and methods of the courts which administer
our criminal laws proceed upon an entirely different theory.
Our penal laws are enacted for the purpose of promoting
the happiness and well-being of society at large, and any
who violate them are termed criminals and outlawed as unfit
units of society. The penalty provided for under these
laws is imposed with the end in view of deterring the offender
from again violating his obligation to the body politic and
also of deterring others who might be like-minded.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In some other fields the introduction of the social worker
simply adds a new sort of service to what is already given.
The obligations of both the doctor and the medical social
worker are to the welfare of the patient, but their work is
complementary. Often the social worker has responsibilities
no less than the doctor’s but her diagnosis is of a situation
and its possible interference with the curative process
the doctor prescribes. She must discover and change working
conditions or personal habits that tend to defeat the
doctor’s efforts. It is not a mere accident that this became
the task of a social worker. It is not because it was no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>medical job and the charitably inclined were available for
it. It is because of a certain characteristic of social work
which is a direct result of the single minded address to the
service of need—namely, a tendency to look upon people
from no point of view but that of interest in their needs,
of whatever sort those needs may be. This habit of taking
a <i>synthetic</i> view of their lives, if such an expression is permissible,
gives exactly what was needed to complement the
special and limited services of the doctor.</p>

<p>The same is true in the case of the social worker in the
schools.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It is not because there is no other obvious title
to give her that the school visitor is called a social worker
but because her responsibility is not to the standards demanded
by the school system nor to any subject of instruction
but to the child himself and the need of the child in
any capacity in which that need may occur. She must
satisfy the need or put him in contact with others who
will. The same is true of social workers employed to give
suitable distribution to the benevolence of churches or who
investigate for government departments or administer government
services. There is abundant evidence that this
concern for the individual as such is what is everywhere expected
of the social worker. It is a paradox of this modern
development of philanthropy that scientific method should
have led away from generalization and formula and to a
separation of the individual from the category and the predicament.
One can pick up a “Survey” of any date and read
of the social workers reviewing all sorts of data for light on
the nature of individual lives. They study official records of
vagrancy and extract from them information about vagrants.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
They attempt to give relevance to Americanization
work by studying the specific backgrounds of diverse foreign
groups.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Miss Addams writes of the settlement that “the social
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>injury of the meanest man not only becomes its concern,
but by virtue of its very locality, it has put itself into a
position to see, as no one but a neighbor can see, the stress
and need of those who bear the brunt of the social injury.”
This is in a certain sense true of other forms of
social work as well. Because of their interest in individual
lives, and their constant response to the challenge in every
sort of insufficiency and adversity they transcend the ordinary
barriers of social provincialism and come to know
everywhere those who bear the brunt of the social injury.
The social worker seems always to be speaking for someone
who has not managed as well as possible for himself, or for
whom life has arranged badly, or who is not old enough or
strong enough to be his own guardian. He often looks like
a fool rushing in where angels might well fear to tread, but
we must concede that he is doing for someone in an apparently
untenable position things that only the self-sufficing
can do for themselves. This synthesis of the interest of
all social work in “personal” predicaments is indicated in
the word “social,” for our social relations are simply our
relations as persons. But it seems to need further exposition
because the word social has been used loosely and no
longer carries clear-cut implications. A lawyer speaking to
the 1919 convention defines “individual” interests as “the
claims which the human being makes simply because he is
a human being. For example, the claims to be secure in
his reputation and honor, in his social existence, to be
secure in his belief and opinion, his spiritual existence,
to be secure in his domestic relations, in his expanded
individual existence and to be secure in his substance,
his economic existence.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It will be noted that, in
the attempt to define these individual interests even
a superlatively able lawyer could come no nearer to
legal precision than to say “for example.” The concept
is one which social work itself continues to alter,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>fill out and expand with every breath it draws and is not
the less significant because it is elusive. As social work becomes
more systematic with an almost technical practice,
more dissociated from the specific act of relief and more
widely and variously allied with the practices of other callings
this personal, this “social” interest, becomes increasingly
important as one of its distinguishing features.</p>

<p>We may recapitulate the effects of the extension of a charitable
interest into new fields. The charitable interest working
along scientific lines has produced what we know as social
work and social work continues to manifest that interest
as its characteristic feature in all the widely scattered fields
to which human needs have called it. It is, first, everywhere
engaged in the gratuitous extension of benefits. That
is to say, it performs services which, while they may be
officially sanctioned, are discretionary and adjustable, and
are not considered established rights in any but the most
broadly construed humanitarian sense. Secondly, it is concerned
with negative conditions; not the successes but the
failures interest it, not the promising people but the difficult
people, not the leaders but the under-dogs. And
thirdly, as social work begins to operate in close association
with many other services, we see, what was always implicit
in charity but now first stands out in sharp relief, a prime
interest in the personal needs of individual beneficiaries.
This puts social work in a new relation to public affairs for
it not only stands by to gather up the human wreckage of
bad management but it brings to formalized administration
a constant and well-posted challenge to meet individual
requirements.</p>


<h4>THE PROPOSED DEFINITION</h4>

<p>Diversity in social work may today be more conspicuous
than likeness but under the diversity essential likeness can
still be traced. Despite all appearances to the contrary it
has its own department of human affairs and its universal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
common interest inherited from charity and to this department
of human affairs, to the service of this interest, it
brings a method adopted from science.</p>

<p>The <i>department of human affairs</i> in which social work
operates is that indicated by the word “social”; men’s relations
to each other rather than their relations to nature.
The <i>interest</i> inherited from charity is an interest in untoward
situations; social work, like charity turns like a compass
to the magnet of need; opportunity, success, superiority
do not attract it unless they are beset with some difficulty
which it can remove; handicap, deprivation, insufficiency
offer the challenge to which it responds. The <i>method</i>
adopted from science is that of observation and generalization;
social work has established the fact that just as man
cannot live without a certain food supply, so he cannot
thrive as a conscious being without a modicum of interest,
incentive, and leeway of freedom, so that matters long considered
intimate and implicit have now become the objects
of close and deliberate observation. And just as men, endlessly
varied in physical appearance are to the physiologist
of one general pattern and as, far more strangely, the infinite
variety of mind is known by the psychologist to have
its common laws of operation, so, strangest and most illusive
of all, men individually unpredictable, do yet, in the
main, follow laws of social behaviour which it is in the power
of an observer to detect. We can say that the main act
and final object of social work are those of charity. The
means and methods are those of science moving in the fields
of charitable concern. Social work seems to comprise a
group of allied activities called by a common name and considered
to be but various phases of a single undertaking
because they are all engaged in spontaneous efforts to
extend benefits in response to the evidence of need; they all
show a major interest in improving the social relationship
of their beneficiaries and all avail themselves of scientific
knowledge and employ scientific methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>We may propose as a tentative definition, to be tested and
carried further in the chapters which follow, that social
work includes all voluntary attempts to extend benefits in
response to need which are concerned with social relationships
and which avail themselves of scientific knowledge
and employ scientific methods.</p>

<h3>THE TESTIMONY OF THE CONFERENCE</h3>


<p>We have now propounded a tentative definition of social
work based upon an interpretation of its development and
present practices. We will not be sure of the correctness
of that interpretation until we have tested the applicability
of the result to the whole range of social work. Nor can
we do this fairly by making our own presentation of social
work. For such a test we must find some ready-made presentation
which will marshal social work in all its diversity.
The reports of the national conference do this and, indirectly,
the courses offered by the school for training social
workers. This chapter will test and, if possible, expand
the definition by the testimony of the conference and the
succeeding chapter by the testimony of the schools.</p>

<p>The conference is divided into ten sections:</p>

<ol>
<li>Children.</li>
<li>Delinquents.</li>
<li>Health.</li>
<li>Public agencies and institutions.</li>
<li>The family.</li>
<li>Industrial and economic problems.</li>
<li>The local community.</li>
<li>Mental hygiene.</li>
<li>Organization of social forces.</li>
<li>Uniting of native and foreign-born.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the annual convention each of these ten sections holds
its own group meetings at which papers are presented and
discussions conducted on the subjects appropriate to the
section. It will be seen that the division into sections is
on a basis of administrative fields rather than technique
or function. The fields however are not mutually exclusive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
but overlapping. Children although giving their name to
the whole first section appear among “delinquents” in the
second, candidates for health in the third and so on. Indeed,
all of the ten section names might serve as subheads
under most or all of the other topics.</p>

<p>More significant in the search for a definition is the fact
that these several fields are not exclusively possessed by
social workers. “Children” are also the special concern of
elementary teachers, “delinquency” is primarily referred
to the courts, “health” is the conceded bailiwick of the medical
profession and so forth. Even at the conference many
papers are presented by persons other than social workers.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>These two types of overlapping make the masses of material
with which we have to deal both indeterminate and
confusing. But representing as they do the mutual interpenetration
of social work and other callings, they give a
fresh opportunity to distinguish the nature of social work.
We may inquire what is the special interest of social work
in “children,” in “delinquents,” in “health,” and in what
ways does it differ from the respective interests of teaching,
law, medicine and so forth.</p>

<p>It is obviously impossible to review in readable compass
the fifty years in which the conference has met and, as
there have been great changes in social work during that
time, it would be profitless for a contemporary definition.
A new arrangement of sections was made in 1918, and
therefore the reports of the years 1918, 1919, and 1920
(the last in print when this study was made) were chosen
for detailed analysis.</p>

<p>That analysis can be most simply presented to the reader
by sections, putting before him an itemized statement of
the subjects covered in the reports of each section (treating
the three years as a unit) and then following this sectional
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>review with such considerations as have recommended
themselves cumulatively and can only be offered on
the basis of the material as a whole. We are looking for the
characteristics of social work as a whole and can therefore
consider only such features as continue to show themselves
throughout the sections. In the following itemized lists
for each section the figures represent the number of papers
in which the subject indicated was the principle topic.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>I. CHILDREN.</p>

<p>The forty-five papers presented in this section dealt with the

<p>It requires but a glance at the above list to see how much
wider is its range than that of a teachers’ or medical men’s
convention. There is nothing to connect the topics—except
children. This synthesis of social work in personality
which has been already indicated as the “social” element in
social work becomes increasingly evident in any review of
the conference. As it has proved difficult of definition it
will be well to keep it in mind in order that it may take
shape during the following review:</p>

<p>Such, in briefest possible outline is the scope of the annual
conference on social work. What have its papers contributed
to the correction or expansion of a definition?</p>

<p>The first proposition of the tentative definition was that
all forms of social work originated in a spontaneous effort
to extend benefits. How is this affected by the testimony
of the conference? In the first place it is abundantly confirmed.
The conference papers deal pre-eminently with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
pioneering in the extension of benefits and opportunities.
The phraseology does not always suggest this but one has
only to look beyond the phraseology to the action in order
to find it. If we look at the first section we see it to be in
effect proposing that the whole community shall deliberately
and without delay rearrange not only schools and home
life but industry and general living conditions so as to give
to all its children opportunity and encouragement such as
are now given only to the most fortunate. We find it advocating
a scheme of child welfare on a county basis which
shall seek out “all children in need of care for any reason”
and demanding enforcement of proper health precautions
for the children of unenlightened parents and a real chance
in life for the illegitimate child. Among the titles of this
one section at one conference appear “Progress Toward
Better Laws,” “Planks in a 1920 Platform,” “Lessons from
North Carolina,” “A Community Program, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But these
platforms and programs are not to be ascribed to the community
in any sense except that of being proposed for the
community as a whole by social workers. At the same conference
they are discussing “Social Workers as Interpreters”
of social conditions and methods of getting “publicity”
for their aims.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The same sort of title takes up the tale in
the next section, a “Program” again, “Aims and Methods”
twice, “A Plan,” and so on throughout the conference.
Although other professions, education and medicine for example,
are constantly busy jacking up standards, their general
undertakings are fully accepted. For all regular purveyances
of education and medicine the community has
given a blanket order and expects to pay “within reason.”
Social work is in a different case for it is constantly trying
to put over something which is still but tentatively and experimentally
accepted and depends root and branch on the
willingness of some people to do, out of hand, for others.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>The president of the conference in 1920 referred to a “belief
in human improvableness and a willingness to tackle the
job.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> That is as far as the conference usually philosophises
in this direction. And this is the sort of phraseology
that makes one forget that social work is extending benefits—this
casual reference to tackling the job. It is another
of the paradoxes in the development of social work
(we have already noted science rescuing personality), that
when charity offered only a minimum of rough food, uniform
raiment and herded shelter to the utterly destitute
there was much made of the generosity of the donor, but
now when social work has been carried to a point where it
often provides for the handicapped a great deal better than
the rank and file manage to provide for themselves it is
taken to be a case of noblesse oblige.</p>

<p>We may read in the “Observations of a Philanthropist”
penned a century ago that “It’s greatly for the interests of
charity that the objects of it should be respectful and grateful.
We think our kindness in a manner repaid when it
is thankfully received; it’s a pleasure then to have done it
and an incitement to do more,”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> or in a “hospital” report
that “the number of proper objects are amply sufficient to
employ the bounty of the rich.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The difference here indicated is not accounted for by the
fact that these were the observations of philanthropists
while the conference is composed of professional social
workers for whom benefaction is all in the day’s work. As
has been already indicated, the papers read at the conference
are not all by social workers. Furthermore, the “incitement”
now employed to get from all manner of men
financial support for the undertakings of social work is of
a very different order. Let any one consider the appeals
which come to his desk. They contain little to rouse his
vanity and the offer of an opportunity to acquire merit is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>almost as uncommon. The degree of need and the certainty
of accomplishment are the things never omitted.</p>

<p>This suggests the cause for change. A century ago need
might equally well have been urged, but what could then
have been promised of accomplishment? All that was then
expected was surcease of the hour’s suffering. That is a
fit subject of congratulation as when a complaisant philanthropist
wrote of the London of his time there “is not a
disease that can afflict human nature nor a want which the
varying conditions of man can require but finds an open
asylum, a resort ready prepared with the needful accommodation
for reception, comfort, instruction and cure, and with
the exception of a few cases entirely free of expense.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>But what is that compared with the great modern adventure
of eliminating poverty and holding disease at bay? Science
has brought to charity faith and hope in terrestrial
terms. The historian who unearthed the above statement
remarks, “In theory, society consists of a large number of
charitable people; in fact the number of those who can be
properly so described is a small one. The few who are
really in earnest in their desire to alleviate distress even at
the cost of considerable expenditure of time and money, are
surrounded by a multitude of persons who are willing to assist
but only provided they can do so at no great inconvenience
to themselves. This lower power of sympathy passes
gradually through the stages of languid interest to complete
indifference.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Modern social work is no longer dependent on the appeal
to “sympathy” alone. It has a wide range of interest and
through its practical application of the various social sciences
it associates itself with all our hopes of progress. Expectation
not only to mitigate the effects of calamity but to
prevent its recurrence gives social work a claim on public
attention which charity never had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Along with this change in expectation goes naturally a
change in attitude toward the beneficiaries of social work.
“There can be no line of cleavage in the advancement of
public sentiment between the development of the general
social agencies such as church and school and the more intensive
forms which we have come to know as social
work.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The old view of society saw many staunch persons
standing on their own feet and a few weak brethren
or victimized who needed support. But the view implied
in this quotation recognizes an interdependence among all
the members of society, an interdependence of which the
particular predicament of those who happen to be in need
of social work is merely an incident.</p>

<p>But the speakers at the conference go still further. “So
long as there are human frailties there will be need of social
workers. But let us not forget that the larger vision of
social work contemplates not charity alone but justice, and
all social ills arising from environment are man-made and
therefore changeable.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> If the beneficiaries of social work
are thus counted scapegoats for us all, being victims of social
injustice, then every act of prevention (and we have said
that all social work is now at some remove preventive) is for
the general safety and no more than a proper self-defence.
Social work now resents the smugness that can represent
as especially disinterested any service to those who have
been paying the penalty of blunders or iniquities for which
the prosperous may be equally responsible. It is only justice
to them or less and it is sound policy for all. No wonder
social work will not stand to be considered charity! It
considers its preoccupation with the backwaters of race
progress to show no gracious condescension on its part—merely
an appreciation of the extent and importance of the
backwaters.</p>

<p>But all this shows social work more than ever spontaneous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>and gratuitous, for it does not work for even a heavenly
reward; and it must, unadmonished, stir the community
to support the work it sets itself to perform. It is
only the old condescension that has gone. The extension
of benefits remains, but has become something constructive
and collectivistic.</p>

<p>Such a change in attitude toward benefaction would necessarily
affect the second criterion of social work proposed
in our tentative definition—its incidence in response to need.
What is the testimony of the conference on this second
criterion? The analysis of subjects dealt with in the first
section reads “plans for removing <i>handicaps</i>,” “recreational
<i>needs</i>,” “<i>protective</i> schemes,” “standards for child <i>care</i>,”
“nature and causes of <i>delinquency</i>,” “providing for children
<i>dependent</i> on the public,” “responsibilities to <i>neglected</i>
children,” “health <i>needs</i>.” Two subjects, which as
given, do not commit themselves on the question of need
complete the list. In the second section the persons under
consideration are by definition subject to some sort of provision
and control. They are delinquents. But that the
interest of the social workers is especially in fostering and
guarding them is shown by the fact that young people’s
need of protection is the subject of six papers, juvenile delinquency
of two, runaway and neglected girls of one more,
while the rest deal with adjustment of treatment to the
needs of older offenders, with probation, parole, education
and the form of detention desirable in a given case. The
third section deals entirely with standards of living in relation
to disease conditions, and with means of extending
medical service. The remaining seven sections continue to
show need as the occasion of social work, but it is a sublimated
sort of need which would be much misrepresented by
any classification of the beneficiaries as “needy.” The whole
level of interest has passed above and beyond that.</p>

<p>As has been already indicated discussion turns on “programs,”
“plans,” “standards,” and it is in a positive and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
anticipatory vein as by people embarked on a constructive
undertaking. The note of initial accomplishment is most
clearly struck in the “local community” division with such
titles as “The Boy Scout and Community Building,” “Organization
of Games and Athletics in Rural Communities,”
“Signs of Rural Hope,” etc. But turn to the context and
you will read, “The Scout program recognizes the need of
the boy for a recreational program for his unused time
which at the same time is educational. Scouting also recognizes
the need that the man has, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The neglected
rural situation, the poverty of interest in some neighborhoods—these
are what have drawn social work to undertakings
that carry no hint of remedy in the expression
given their objects.</p>

<p>In a dynamically conceived society it is hard to say where
remedy shades into prevention and prevention into construction.
Prevention of disaster not only involves the
maintenance of continuously good conditions but the anticipation
of wants. If we are not to have juvenile delinquency
boys must have some chance for wholesome recreation.
If we would avoid bad housing we must arrange
betimes a good city plan preserving open spaces where
they will be wanted later and developing each type of building
in a neighborhood where it need not be soon perverted
to a use for which it was not intended and will not be well
adapted.</p>

<p>Dr. Simon Patten contended that the present productivity
of the world was such as to free mankind from any fear
of general dearth and cause all our prospects to be potentially
in terms of abundance and not of want, to rescue us
from the old “pain economy” of insufficiency and give us a
“pleasure economy” on a safe margin of sufficiency. Under
these circumstances, he said, “world riches may replace the
living sacrifice and become the social contrivance that
lowers human costs and we must cease to think that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>anguish of the sentient creature is compensated by the
development of moral qualities which merely reconcile man
to repeating the experience of suffering.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Social work
has already ceased to think in that fashion and is working
in the spirit of a pleasure economy so that the terminology
of need is no longer pre-eminent. “There are times when
self-sacrificing zeal is demanded and all honor to those who
then devote or lose themselves in service. That is only one
side of it. The need of sacrifice is always a reflection on
the men or circumstances calling for it.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> That is the
view of modern social work, the frame of mind in which
it sets about its work. It talks about what has to be done
as a matter of course and is chiefly concerned with the best
way of doing it. It is beginning to outgrow “sob stories”
even in asking support from an indifferent public—they
set too low a standard of toleration and there are some
modern social workers who turn from them abashed, as
from dallying with an outrage beneath endurance. The
battle ground of reform must be on another plain where
the initiated see danger but the complaisant still need
convincing.</p>

<p>“When once the worst is gone the second best becomes
intolerable.” Gray, the historian of English philanthropy,
describes the effective philanthropist as the ideal agitator,
“It is his to discover those larger ends of common welfare
which reach beyond the moral perceptiveness of ordinary
men in their ordinary moods. He is, as it were, an explorer
in the unmapped world of the ideal life from whence he
brings back news of an unreached good, such tidings as
sound like travelers’ tales in our ears, but which haunt the
mind of men until they seek to verify the story by a practical
policy calculated to transform the actual. Only it
must be observed that the most daring speculator cannot
move very far from his base and the wildest Utopia is determined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>by the conditions of its year of publication.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>“I hold,” said Dr. Southard to the 1919 conference,
“whatever the ideal order, the practical order of work
called social work begins with the eradication of evil. It
may sound better to sow goodness or to transplant goodness,
or even to graft goodness in the eager social world,
and beautiful little gardens of Eden or smaller cases of
goodness can be shown here and there to the social visitor—nevertheless,
I hold, with the prejudice of a physician
perhaps, the eradications of evil are more in the first order
of our work than disseminations, transplantations, and
grafts of goodness. At any rate, if there be anything at
all in the millennial hopes and ingrained optimisms of Spencerian
evolution, it is plain that by and large we are putting
evil behind us and arriving at goodness by a clever
technique of successful destruction.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This “eradication
of evil” may, as one side of the “technique” of evolution,
operate in the terms of any developing organization; but
in terms of eradication of evil, not in its own functioning
or its subject, but in the conditions of its object it is not
common outside of social work. It is not to be found in
the business world where all purveyance shuns the applicant
most in need of its wares and seeks the one best able
to pay. It is not to be found in the law, which tries to
hold the scales even to all comers. It is only slightly and
intermittently in state-craft which while it is coming more
and more to inhibit abuse of the helpless does still, from an
age-old sense of security in the alliance with wealth and
power, bend its constructive energies to encouragement of
the prosperous. It is not even in education, which constantly
tends to provide in each school grade teaching suitable
for those who will have longest to study and is only
importuned by demands from <i>outside</i> to cater in the lower
grades to those who must get in them all the education they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>are ever to have. Social work stands alone in its purely
personal championship of the less secure in prosperity. It
is in its enormous demands for them that it seems to have
turned to purely constructive things.</p>

<p>It is indeed possible that along the lines of prevention
social work is developing a function which is positive in the
same sense as hygiene is positive in the field of medicine
and that social work will, to that extent, independently
“plant good” as well as “eradicate evil.” But it is also possible,
and in the light of past developments more probable,
that any constructive phase of social work which proves
permanent should come to be looked on as a routine purveyance
and no longer considered social work. This we
have already seen to have happened in the case of free education
and many other things.</p>

<p>The conference has thus confirmed and filled out the elementary
features of social work which it inherits from
charity, voluntary benefaction and response to need. What
does it have to say of the qualifying features that have
transformed charity into social work—the emergence of the
individual as the only and sufficient nexus for its services
and the adoption of scientific guidance?</p>

<p>The first of these has already been touched on in relation
to the first section. Throughout the second the discussion
all bears on the prevention of delinquency or the care of
delinquents. There is not much discussion of pure justice,
the burden of the argument is all that we should “approach
every individual prisoner with conscientious determination
to give him the best service of which we are capable, realizing
that his future is largely in our hands.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> A public defender
is asked for “in order that every person accused, no
matter how poor, may have a full and fair trial.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> And
for sentenced prisoners social work asks something more
than mere detention, “we used to look upon them, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>stage of repression, en masse. * * * Instead of committing
a man to a particular institution he is now committed
to the custody of a board of control * * * to be examined
* * * to determine just where he will fit into school or
industry. The man will be assigned by his board, to the
particular prison to which he is best suited for mental and
physical treatment.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> “If a child who is mentally sound
comes into court with a mind bent on the commission of
some offence he should be sent to a special school having
for its purpose the education of such children. Let the
great departments of psychology and sociology of our colleges
and universities devise a course of instruction and
education that will reclaim a juvenile delinquent who is
mentally and physically sound”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and “we should extend
the methods developed in the Children’s Courts to apply to
all ages, wiping out our arbitrary age line by improving
the treatment of the older groups.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>It is in this section that there appears at its plainest the
paradox that the questions purely dependent on what we
call personality are questions of social relationship and all
genuinely social questions are questions of personal life. A
public policy is justified in terms of personal benefit but interest
is claimed for personal difficulties on the ground that
they illuminate public issues.</p>

<p>The third division is one that speaks quite unequivocally
concerning the nature of social work, for there is an old
and kindly profession already established in this field and
social work must justify its own entrance there. All of
the subjects in this health section are of interest to the
doctor as well as the social worker, but for the doctor they
throw light on the causes and cures of disease, for the
social worker they are a point of departure for active work
to establish better standards of living. Nineteen of the
papers presented deal specifically with that subject. Five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>more deal with the co-ordination of various health agencies—a
task in social engineering. One speaker, himself
a physician, reports no less than ten agencies united in
efforts to improve a city’s health. Only four of these (the
board of health, the hospital, the tuberculosis society and
the medical profession) were permanently concerned with
health. The other six, the schools, the park department,
the city statistics department, the industries, insurance
companies and churches were enlisted, as the context
shows, as so many agents establishing connections with the
individual beneficiaries of the campaign. The work of
choosing them and enlisting their co-operation demanded a
knowledge of social not of physiological conditions.</p>

<p>In the next section, that devoted to public agencies and
institutions, the conspicuous fact is that social work does
not forget that public care is for private people. It hardly
seems necessary to quote from all the sections even in pursuit
of this most elusive of the characteristics of social
work. One more citation will be enough. “We social
workers have our contribution to make to that ultimate
attainment of democracy which must be wrought out, not
in uniformity but in diversity, not only in the right of man
to individual freedom but in his ability to enter into that
right.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The extension of the sense of public responsibility, the
realization that reform must come in all the interlocking
activities of a highly organized business, political and social
life has tempted some people to think that the days of
social work are numbered or to seek out for it some highly
specialized or recondite function. But if we are right in
ascribing to it this function of challenging all forms of
service to reach and satisfy individual needs it may be more
important in the future than in the past. Wholesale and
collectivist methods call for constant adaptation of general
means to particular cases and the more we give of government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>service the more we may need of social work. The
more varied our health service, the more flexible and extensible
our educational opportunities, the more occasions
there will be for adjustment. Such follow-up work as is
done by hospitals and by the workmen’s compensation
office, the work of the mothers’ assistance fund, of the
voluntary experiments in special nutrition classes, vocational
guidance, and scholarships for trade school attendance,
are only a few examples of the kind of thing social
work branches into as established agencies extend their
own responsibilities.</p>

<p>The fact that social work rescues people who fall through
the meshes of the school system, people dismissed from
clinical treatment only to return to a regimen bound to revive
their troubles, that it discovers the round pegs in square
holes and the neglected groups and anomalous cases has
caused other people to see it as all converging in a liaison
work which shall ultimately be all there is left for it to
perform and which shall be in essence social case work.
From what has already been said it will be evident that
there is no reason to think that social work which has been
so prolific of criticism of our established institutions and
a pioneer in experiment should cease to exercise this function,
which is as infinite in possibilities as the life of man
itself, or even that it will cease to work along lines of inquiry
or of group work. That little word “social” opens up
the possibilities of all the permutations and combinations
in human consciousness. The conference at least hints that
social work knows it.</p>

<p>And what of the method by which social work is to be
conducted. Is it, as the tentative definition said, suggested
by the social sciences? There is not a great deal of explicit
reference to social science, but the concepts of economics,
social psychology and sociology are constantly in
evidence and even political science has its say in an “engineering”
conception of the state, in definitions of democracy
and in criteria of progress. The almost complete disappearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
of the question of relative responsibility of the
individual and society which morality and philosophy have
debated in so many forms testifies to assimilation of the
sociological concept of social life as an integration of individual
lives rather than an aggregation and of the individual
life as no digit but an incident “* * * time moves
swiftly in the social field and the special knowledge of today
easily becomes the common knowledge of tomorrow.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
And after all that has been said in the preceding pages of
the obvious effects of a scientific method and scientific attitude
in making social work what the conference shows it
to be it scarcely remains to prove or even argue the confirmation,
the reinforcement, the expansion of the last
qualification of social work.</p>

<p>Nine round-table conferences and five committee reports,
in addition to the papers presenting concrete programs and
reports of local experiments testify to the careful checking
up of method. The constant references to programs,
standards and experience, to records and the search for
causes, the emphasis on prevention and the patient, objective,
therapeutic attitude of the social worker all testify to
the conquest of the field by science. But the completeness
and significance of that conquest are plainest in the ever-present,
implicit but unmistakable assumption that all the
undertakings discussed are parts of a systematically coordinated
campaign based upon continuing observation of
cause and effect.</p>

<p>Thus have the reports of the conference confirmed and
filled out the tentative definition. But the analysis did not
cull from them any fresh characteristics of social work.
Their mass of commentary, aimed, as it seemed, in all possible
directions, would suggest no testimony except in
answer to leading questions and we will have to be satisfied
with such expansion of the definition as, while adding no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>new terms, commits the already proposed items to more
significant implications. The definition so expanded must
be passed on, for challenge or alteration by the evidence of
the training schools.</p>

<h3>THE TESTIMONY OF THE SCHOOLS</h3>


<p>There are some fifteen schools for the training of social
workers,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> independent institutions or university departments.
The younger among them have not followed at all
closely the organization or practices of the older<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and all
work in close co-operation with local social work agencies,
farming their students out with these for practice work
and drawing lecturers from the agency staffs. The varied
curricula of the schools seem therefore to offer direct evidence
of what is considered in their respective regions, the
most necessary equipment for social workers.</p>

<p>Only three school catalogues venture any characterization
of the tasks for which their courses equip. Toronto
gives the most inclusive. “The sense of social obligation
and interdependence has grown greater as our social life
has grown more complex. The more social conditions have
been studied, the more apparent has it become that many
of our worst evils are due to the lack of the science which
should direct and stimulate the sense of our solidarity. In
recent years governments, municipal and other authorities,
industrial corporations and voluntary associations of
all kinds have been compelled to make ever-extending provisions
for industrial protection, social insurance, public
health service, housing improvement, recreation and various
other forms of organized social effort. All these
activities have created the sphere of a new profession, that
of the trained social worker.” Here are the familiar “sense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>of social obligation,” the reference to a “science which
should direct and stimulate this sense,” the “<i>ever-extending</i>
provisions” prompted by it and, unmentioned but obviously
implicit, a constant concern with things subject to
amelioration: “protection,” “insurance,” “service,” “improvement,”
“recreation”—these are the substantives in
its main statement. The Ohio catalogue itemizes the demands
of social service on a training school<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> but the only
generalization to be deduced from the list is that they all
imply a purpose of rescue or amelioration. The Simmons
characterization confines itself entirely to emphasizing
the implications of the word “social”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and the Missouri
school opens its catalogue with the discouraging statement
that “it is impossible at the present time to construct a
satisfactory definition of social work.”</p>

<p>This exhausts the slender sheaf of direct comment. For
further enlightenment we must analyse the offered
equipment itself. The nature of the training given will
predict the nature of the work expected to follow. There
are a great many courses offered and the variety not of
nomenclature only but of apparent content is enough for
bewilderment. Classification of the courses according to
the type of preparation they seem to offer does however
sort them into three main groups.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hanging-indent1">
A. Courses which introduce the student to the social sciences
and the methods and concepts on which these
rest.</p>

<p class="hanging-indent1">
B. Courses which offer information on the field of social
work both past and present.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>
<p class="hanging-indent1">
C. Courses which equip specifically for certain social
work tasks.</p>
</div>

<p>In the first group, that of courses introducing the student
to the social sciences, their methods and concepts, fall sociology
courses of various sorts, courses in (1) general sociology,
(2) the history of institutions, (3) theories of social
progress, (4) the value of norms of income and opportunity
for a given level of civilization, (5) the means of “social
control.” Here also belong courses in (6) general psychology,
(7) social psychology, (8) statistics and (9)
economics.</p>

<p>In the second group, that of courses offering information
on the general field of social work, fall courses on (1) the
nature and mutual relations of contemporary social work
undertakings, (2) the history of philanthropy and (3) current
social problems. Here ought also to be put (4) the
courses offered by five schools in the causes of poverty, because
poverty has been an age-long challenge to philanthropy
and is still the proximate occasion for a great part
of social work.</p>

<p>For the third group are left courses in about forty subjects
pertaining to special fields or special methods. These
subjects overlap and interchange material but yield to
classification as preparatory for work in eight or nine
fairly distinguishable fields.</p>

<ol>
<li>Work in the interest of the public health, mental or physical.</li>

<li>Organization of community groups on various scales in both urban
and rural areas.</li>

<li>Work in connection with industry.</li>

<li>Work in the interest of children.</li>

<li>Work with people socially handicapped because of race or recent
immigration.</li>

<li>Work in connection with the enactment or administration of social
legislation.</li>

<li>Work with defectives.</li>

<li>Housing.</li>
</ol>


<p>A ninth field may be made of social case work, as when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
appears under such titles as “family rehabilitation,” but it
must also be recognized as a technique more or less utilized
in six of the eight other fields. There remain a few other
technical courses such as those in record keeping.</p>

<p>The schools, all but four,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> arrange their courses in departments
varying in number from two to ten. Altogether
seventeen different fields are indicated by the several
schools and under them are variously grouped the forty
subjects taught.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> These very involved curricula dealing,
as they do, in such staggering propositions as the nature of
progress and the causes of poverty, and seeming in their
explicit statements unanimous in nothing which might
serve the cause of definition do give certain collective
testimony.</p>

<p>In the first place they are agreed that social work comprises
a variety of separate callings demanding differential
training. The differential training is not the result of
specialization after receiving a common training. Most
schools while requiring a certain amount of common background
for all students recognize no general course and require
every student to enroll in one or another department.</p>

<p>Secondly, in making a great deal of elective work interchangeable
among the special courses and requiring certain
prerequisites for all courses alike they all recognize a close
relation between the various branches of social work.</p>

<p>Thirdly, they show that the work they prepare for is not
“social” in the merely vague sense of having a public interest.
It is social in the specific sense of dealing with
people in their relations to other people. Its prerequisite
is not physiology, the science of that part of man which
can develop in isolation, but psychology, the science of intelligence
which develops only in contact with other intelligences.
We can see this in the contrast between the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>training given in a medical school and that given in a school
for social workers. The former teaches a great deal about
man’s physical make-up and its hazards but very little
about his mental make-up: while the latter may teach
enough of sanitary practice to understand a doctor’s directions,
almost always teaches something of mental life and
always a great deal about social settings and the available
means of improving them. This “social” interest is constant
throughout the schools. The courses in industry, for
example, do not teach efficiency engineering or price fixing
but personnel management and other matters presumably
ministering directly to the well being of the workers. These
schools do not equip for the advancement of any particular
science. Philosophy and art of any sort enter them only
as casual visitors. They teach in the name of no single
creed and formulate no specific purpose. Despite their
enormous array of topics their interest remains essentially
personal.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the schools are more or less consciously training
crusaders. The word “problem” is in frequent use. It
is freely applied to difficulties not outstandingly problematical
and its use in place of any harsher or less hopeful word
indicates the notion of arming rescuers with a solution.
The word “standard” with its implication of something attainable
but not always attained, “prevention,” “service,”
“welfare,” “relief,” “correction,” “treatment,” appear
thickly scattered among the subject titles and one is surely
justified in inferring that to make changes for the better
is not to be for the social worker as for most men a rare
bright spot in the routine of labor, but his very stock-in-trade
and justification for existence.</p>

<p>Lastly, the requirement of a certain amount of study of
the social sciences followed by methodical training in special
lines, together with supervised practice work after the
manner of a technical school, testifies to the important parts
played in the preparation of social workers by both scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
method and the lore of the social sciences.</p>

<p>Beyond this it does not seem safe to generalise. These
five conclusions about social work indicated by the school
catalogues suggest that it is an alliance of distinct but
closely related callings furthering “social” welfare in a
quite specific sense. Secondly, they imply that the social
worker is a rescuer and champion equipped for his tilt from
the armory of the social sciences. Does not this come to
about the same thing as is described in our tentative definition,
a group of activities looked upon as so many phases
of a single undertaking because they all attempt to extend
benefits in response to a need; are all concerned with
social relationships; and all avail themselves of scientific
knowledge and employ scientific methods.</p>

<p>The schools then, like the conference, confirm the tentative
definition but do not expand it by the addition of any
new terms. It is possible that social work as a whole has
no more common features. But it is, of course, also possible
that other features could be found if we had some
fresh clue to them. The present study, having put all its
leading questions must again content itself with adding to
the already accepted terms of the definition such further
implications as the curricula suggest—and again we find
these implications to come from the use of science for
philanthropic purposes.</p>

<p>The courses most commonly “required” for all students
in the schools are those treating the social sciences. What
do these offer to the incipient social worker? The courses
in sociology—especially those which thirteen of the schools
offer in the history of certain institutions or in race comparisons—give
perspective. They show institutions changing
in form and function. They show ideas of right
changing as the institutions change, temporary institutions
conditioning our lives even in the matters a layman
supposes instinctive. They force a student to look outside
the setting of custom and creed into which, like every other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
man, he has been born. They show him the provincialism
of sweeping judgments pronounced on the basis of sectional,
sectarian or class standards. They teach him in a
professional capacity (if in no other) to recognize varieties
of good. Yet all the while they are making possible a
simpler and more objectified conception of individuality
than it is easy for the uninstructed to entertain. We look
with something very like amusement on the animistic and
anthropomorphic views of natural phenomena entertained
by primitive men and yet we are only just beginning to
realize that the subjective interpretations and moral judgments
with which we have so long been satisfied in respect
to humanity are equally arbitrary and deductive and that
man also is, up to a certain point a natural phenomenon
to be inductively considered. In such perspective praise
and blame become to many issues irrelevant and we begin
soberly to reckon the possibilities of education in the compass
of individual lifetimes.</p>

<p>Psychology, after sociology the science most frequently
taught in the schools, pushes further the process sociology
began. It shows that our most intimate convictions are
not axiomatic. It shows the thought that is our very
selves to be half the creation of others, and makes the
question of individual blameworthiness a merely practical
one of what forces are to be reckoned with in a given
situation.</p>

<p>The third of the general sciences taught is statistics, the
language of collective fact. By discovering norms it shows
danger lines. It tells what food and what air and what
income are necessary to support life in an average individual
and what degree of development is usual in a child
of a given age and what degree of intelligence suffices to
keep people out of trouble without the protection of a
guardian. It gives the charitably inclined hard facts with
which to face the indifferent and firm ground to stand on
in demanding reform. At first sight it looks like a means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
to intolerable regimentation but rightly used it is a charter
of freedom. Given a knowledge of the margin of safety
we can make a concerted attack on substandard conditions
while allowing indefinite variation above the danger line
and the mere nonconformist need not be dreaded or attacked
for simple nonconformity.</p>

<p>Thus may courses in social science give to many a raw
recruit of social work grounds for acting with the tolerance,
the respect for individuals, the single and unaccusing
eye on present and future possibilities which their elders
and maybe betters had (when they had them at all) as the
rare and not to be commanded gifts of sheer humanity
and wisdom.</p>

<p>Here is the contribution of science to social work which
touches its vital center, refines the very impulse that animates
it, as it animated its predecessors and keeps it true
to form among the distractions of technical formality. No
study can produce imagination, sympathy, generosity or
good taste any more than it can give a student a better
brain, but what it can do is to give to persons of only average
perspicacity and humanity the understanding to act
with some degree of intelligence and consideration where
the untrained average person would make cruel and disastrous
blunders.</p>

<p>The tentative definition of social work which we sought
to test and add to by the testimony of conference and
school curricula has gained no fresh terms but it has
gained in significance and, taken together with all its implications,
makes of social work something thoroughly definitive
and characteristic. But the definition was wanted
for practical purposes and before dropping the subject it
will be necessary to inquire whether it can in any degree
serve them.</p>

<h3>THE ANSWER TO ITS CRITICS</h3>


<p>At the beginning of this study it was said that a definition
of social work was in demand for practical use. We
have developed a definition which seems to hold good as
far as it goes. We have said that social work includes all
voluntary attempts to extend benefits in response to a need,
which are concerned with social relationships and which
avail themselves of scientific knowledge and employ scientific
methods. It remains to test whether this is sufficiently
descriptive and sufficiently definitive to be of any practical
use. Is it inclusive enough to allow social work to claim
all its legitimate functions and exclusive enough to rescue
it from unreasonable demands? These things can only be
tested by trying it out in discussion. It is therefore the
purpose of this chapter to attempt such a trial by assuming
that social work is no more and no less than the definition
indicates and requiring it, on this representation, to
run the gauntlet of familiar criticism.</p>

<p>Up to the present time social work has not been the subject
of much serious analytical comment. It has been too
inchoate for that. But a sort of guerilla warfare of criticism
pursues it in private conversation, on public platforms
and in the obiter dicta of current literature. The
criticisms are of three principal sorts, those which say that
what it does is somehow unworthy, those which say it does
too much and those which say it does too little; or, more
fully stated, those which charge it with an unwholesome
interest in wanting to play providence to other people,
those which think it is attempting something in defiance of
the laws of nature and those which scorn it for tinkering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
with abuses which should be fallen upon and annihilated.</p>

<p>In the first group may be classed the view of people who
find the world well enough as it is and think that social
workers stir up hornets’ nests from sheer meddlesomeness
and love of power. As this belief never survives any considerable
acquaintance with social work or any but very
provincial knowledge of the world it need not be discussed.
More considerable is the criticism of those who object to
social work because they think that to make demands in
the interest of other people is patronizing or sentimental
or both. They think that the people might possibly ask
very different things of life from those which the social
worker asks for them; that if the social worker wishes to
help them he should confine himself to seconding their
motions; that an outsider and mere witness of an abuse who
has never felt its weight is not the one to draw up its
indictment or to prescribe a remedy. But their objection
is not altogether on these grounds. Even when social
work makes the same demands as its clients have made for
themselves the irreconcilables continue to denounce it for
undue interference. Some of them, to be sure, think that
while self-respecting people are asking their plain rights in
their own name and that of justice social work makes it
easy for the community to neglect their demands and yet
salve its conscience by supporting such benefactions as it
finds convenient. But this last belongs with the next group
of criticisms and must be answered along with them. We
are for the moment concerned only with the strange but
apparently rooted belief that there must be something
spurious about a movement in which people are not speaking
for themselves.</p>

<p>It is evident that even people who commend social work,
often do so patronizingly as though it were something not
to be taken very seriously because it is not self-supporting
and cannot claim the great, humdrum, unchallengeable sanction
of self interest. Moreover people in border-line occupations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
when referred to as social workers will repudiate
the name as though it might discredit their work by taking
it out of the busy wholesome world of fair exchanges
and putting it in a world of patronage and possible hypocrisy.
Men advocating industrial welfare work are commonly
not satisfied to claim that it pays for itself and will
be no expense to the business that installs it, but assert
with an air of rescuing it from suspicion, that it results in
a net profit to the man who puts it in and is therefore “not
sentiment” but “good business.” Those who, though
themselves not originally industrial workers, go into the
labor movement, very frequently pour scorn on the social
worker while feeling themselves safe from corrupting condescension
in a company that is only asking for its own
rights.</p>

<p>The element of justice in the charge does not need to
be pointed out. Bernard Shaw has warned us against doing
unto others as we would have them do unto us for fear
they may not like it. But for members of a gregarious
species some tolerance of ministration seems unavoidable.
Within the labor movement itself those with a margin of
time and energy are constantly acting in the interest of
those who have none. We all begin life with several years
of sheer dependence on the altruism of our elders and if
we live long enough come again to some form of dependence.
As we look back on the slow mitigation of man’s
inhumanity to man there seems at least good ground for
putting the burden of proof on those who scorn all benevolent
interference. We have already noticed that what
passes in one generation for special interest in the fortunes
of others seems to a later time plain obligation.</p>

<p>“Almost every law on the statute books,” says a historian,
in reference to protective legislation, “was forced
upon the legislature by the disconcerting zeal of a few
enthusiasts. We marvel at the slight concessions to
humanity which satisfied them, we should rather admire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the originality which led them to denounce cruel and oppressive
conditions which had satisfied the legislature and
against which their victims had not always turned.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> There
is the crux of the matter—the victims will not, cannot
always turn. In the palmy days of utilitarianism when
the opposition to doing for others was felt with the mighty
impact of which the present vague distrust is the last faint
ripple fading across the public mind, Mill himself will be
found writing that although it can be stated as a general
rule “that most persons take a juster and more intelligent
view of their own interest, and of the means of promoting
it, than can either be prescribed to them by a general enactment
of the legislature, or pointed out in the particular
case by a public functionary” nevertheless “there is no difficulty
in perceiving some very large and conspicuous exceptions
to it.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> And among these exceptions he proceeds
to enumerate protection of persons incapable of judging or
acting for themselves whether from defective intelligence
or immaturity, and the protection offered by labor legislation
and by public charity. Elsewhere he also remarks,
“Those who most need to be made wiser and better commonly
desire it least, and if they desired it would be incapable
of finding the way to it by their own lights.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>It could probably be shown that the great bulk of social
work acts in the interest of people unable to speak for
themselves or vaguely wanting something they cannot
find “the way to by their own lights.” But victimization
and helplessness are entirely relative matters and social
work is prepared boldly to extend benefits wherever they
are wanted.</p>

<p>Science has now laid a broad road and is leading the plodding
crowd where the keen feet of Pegasus have always
carried the subtle minded, whatever the contemporary
creed. “Darwin” writes a popular social psychologist “in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>the <i>Descent of Man</i> (1871) first enunciated the true doctrine
of human motives, and showed how we must proceed,
relying chiefly upon the comparative and natural history
method, if we would arrive at a fuller understanding of
them. * * * Social Psychology has to show how, given the
native propensities and capacities of the individual human
mind, all the complex mental life of societies is shaped by
them and in turn reacts upon the course of their development
and operation in the individual. * * * The fundamental
problem of social psychology is moralization of the
individual by the society into which he is born as a creature
in which the non-moral and purely egoistic tendencies are
so much stronger than any altruistic tendencies.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> That
is to say the problem which social psychology must solve
is the problem of how this moralization is brought about.
The significance of such doctrine for social work is in its
entire discrediting of any naive individualism and its indication
that man being an animal that lives not solitary but
in groups some form and degree of interdependence is, for
him, in the first order of nature. The interests and inclinations
corollary to that interdependence are inescapable
for him.</p>

<p>If this is the case objection to the social work we have
defined could not be “on principle” but must be to special
forms of service on specific grounds of inexpediency or because
of the manner or quality of the service. Although it is
the manner and quality of service which make the social
work of any given time and place what it is they are nevertheless
incidentals entirely separable from its nature and
principles. Objections are brought on specific grounds of
expediency by those who claim that social work does too
much and these objections will be considered in their turn.
Objection is also made to the manner and quality of the
social workers’ services and it is this objection which really
animates the charge against the altruism of social work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>
<p>This study is an analysis of the nature and functions, not
the performance of social work. It must, however, consider
a general objection to the nature and quality of the
social workers’ services which so often passes for an objection
to social work itself.</p>

<p>This vague distrust of social work which we have just
been considering, this dislike of it as something sentimental
or undemocratic, is really a dislike of these incidentals
which social work has a perfect right to disclaim if it can.
It is a moral and aesthetic repulsion, an aversion for the
sort of thing which social work sometimes seems to be.</p>

<p>It is social case work that is most open not only to misunderstanding
but to abuse. In it social work is especially
liable to the defects of its qualities. People who take for
granted the social work that is done in connection with the
courts, the schools, institutions dealing with defectives and
in many other connections without troubling to consider
what it is they are accepting and even relying upon, will,
because of what they think social case work to be, pour
scorn upon “uplifters” and social workers generally.</p>

<p>The social case workers’ professional contribution to a
situation consists in doing whatever she does in conscious
relation to a general situation, in the ease of her contacts
and the range of her resources.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> There is no limit to the
knowledge of a situation which it may be useful for her to
have. A speaker addressing the first students in the New
York School of Philanthropy is on record as referring to
“investigation” as a necessary evil which must be bravely
faced and telling them they must always make it plain that
“the person in distress has asked you to help him and that
you <i>mean</i> to help him, to help his soul and not only to feed
his miserable body, and that you cannot help him unless
you do <i>know all about</i> him.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Of course that is to give
an ell when an inch is asked for—and an ell of very different
stuff. The statement was made twenty-five years ago
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>and is not given here as typical either of this time or that,
but as an instance of the sort of thing which is said and
passed on and resented, all in good faith. Obviously the
more the case worker knows, provided she can understand
it, the better she can do her work. But because of the
very real requirement to employ trained workers and the
rapid expansion of the profession young people are employed
as fast as the schools will grind them out. And
when social work lets loose on difficult situations people disqualified
for dealing with them by their youth or inexperience
or native incapacity or all three it must expect its reputation
to suffer. But, taken at the best, there is great presumption
in the attempt of one mortal life to analyze and
prescribe for the totality of another. A too nice matching
up of the inferential motive with the act to be accounted
for, a too meticulous testing for the qualities presumed
necessary for a certain degree of self direction, entail a
veritable invasion of one life by another. It is hard for
the analytical to remember that any explanation, no matter
how true and inclusive, is only one thread drawn from a
web. The generalizations which we can make after taking
cognizance of a certain number of instances are just as
much and as little applicable to any given life as the probability
tables of an insurance company. They are illuminating
as guides to general expectation but will not closely
correspond to any particular case. There cannot be any
authoritative, objective determination of the proper elements
and relationships of life, and any attempt to arrange
for the life of another as a whole is profane. The clearest
sighted come often enough into unlit passages of their own
destiny where they must grope forward in bewilderment
and a kind of awed respect for things which could go unsuspected
and yet all along be “nearer to them than breathing,
closer than hands and feet.” Who then shall interpret
another?</p>

<p>Yet life must be met with a certain hardihood. For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
conspicuously defective we know that self direction is impossible,
and for the intolerably troublesome we accept
coercion, but in the case of the merely dependent there are
delicate lines to be drawn. Social work knows perfectly well
that it is possible to degenerate into “substituting one
neurosis for another.” Hamlet, thrusting on the bewildered
courtier the flute which that courtier could not play,
spoke for many an inarticulate protestor, “Why, look you
now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would
play upon me you would seem to know my stops; you would
pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me
from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there
is much music, excellent voice in this little organ; yet cannot
you make it speak. ’sblood do you think I am easier

<p>Lincoln is credited with the observation that the Lord
never made the man who was good enough to have power
over another man and, by its option of giving or withholding
benefits, social work undoubtedly holds its beneficiaries
very much in its power, not to mention the cases in which
it has actual guardianship, legal or otherwise. A German
social worker accustomed to the strict German notions of
regulation could yet say after a study of American social
work, “an individual is never so absolutely at the mercy
of an administration as when he is the beneficiary of a relief
system.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> It is the social worker who is the champion of
individual rights all down the line from insisting on discrimination
among the men referred to en masse as “the
criminal” to rescuing orphan children from the uniformity
of plaid dresses all of a length. But who shall rescue the
beneficiaries of social work?</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that people sometimes shudder at what
social workers take upon themselves? But these are only
the risks incident to great opportunity. If some social
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>workers run a policy into the ground, if they have neither
imagination, reverence or a sense of humor, that is the
fault of human nature and not the fault of social work.
There are doctors who prescribe for cases they do not
understand and fail to save the patients, there are dishonest
and even addle-headed lawyers who defeat justice, and
there are ministers of religion who are hypocrites, but
their existence does not utterly discredit their professions.
The quotations from the national conference and elsewhere
must have made it clear that this sort of personal imposition
and finessing in control are, if nothing else, too poor
game to attract the main energies of social work. These
have large issues to absorb them and the effect of the scientific
methods and scientific knowledge which our definition
makes essential is to encourage a robust interest in things
clearly knowable and an attitude attentive and curious
rather than dictatorial and inquisitive. Social work being
the lineal descendant of charity has the family weaknesses
and, perhaps even beyond its deserts, the family reputation.
But the one question for anyone willing to do it justice
is whether these weaknesses are characteristic of its
present phase or fading hang-overs from the charity undisciplined
by science. The records of past munificence with
their evidence of interest in giving as a means of grace for
the giver, of indifference regarding the supposed beneficiaries,
of wholesale prescriptions of what is proper for
“the poor,” of breaking up of families, imposition of uniform
labor and total disregard of private claims must be
either unknown or forgotten by people who think a decay
of neighborly respect and an inclination to regiment the
dependent have been produced by the innovations of scientific
social work.</p>

<p>So far we have been trying to get at and answer the
rather vague charges of those who think social work unworthily
employed. Clearer indictments are brought by
the three groups who want us to turn from the defeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
and let them go under. The least extreme of these simply
points out that life unfolds in terms of alternatives and the
time, the skill, the substance and interest lavished by social
work on the incompetent might have given opportunity
to baulked ability. Of course incompetence and ability are
relative matters and some forms of social work could make
out a case for themselves as engaged on the task these
critics would prefer, but it is easy to see the general bearing
of this criticism and by our definition social work is
committed to the very concern for the disadvantaged with
which they charge it. But the definition also stipulated
for the use of scientific knowledge and methods and once
you have social work and social science playing into one
another’s hands you can answer even the baldest utilitarians
on their own grounds. The effort to help where help
is most needed has been to the social work of our definition
a road to prevention of abuses which affect competent and
incompetent alike, a means to better understanding and
control of our social organization. In social as in other
forms of science the normal is often only to be understood
after observation of the abnormal. Moreover, the really
imperative services of social work are evidently forgotten
by these critics as well as by the second group who would
say hands off to social work. These imperative services
can be indicated for both groups at once.</p>

<p>This second group are opposed to social work, not as a
mere waste of means which might be better employed, but
as an actual menace. They think it thwarts the action of
the salutary principle of nature by which the “fittest” survive
their less “fit” brethren. The tacit assumption behind
this view is that if all social work were suspended tomorrow,
vigor and capacity would have pre-eminent survival
value and the unfit would be eliminated and the race
purged of an undesirable inheritance strain.</p>

<p>The race is to the swift and the battle to the strong, but
in modern life, even where there is no social work, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
defeated are not forced clear off the stage with any degree
of promptitude. Complete dismissal comes only by the
arrow that flieth by noonday or the pestilence that walketh
in darkness and our modern versions of these strike the
weak and the strong in a ratio which it would be hard to
compute. War and industrial accidents take not the worst
but the best and some of our most destructive diseases
take, fairly indiscriminately, any who are exposed to them
or their predisposing conditions. Meanwhile, what is there
to extinguish the unfit? Though in a sense defeated they
continue to live on and they leave progeny. Even without
social work they would not starve or freeze to death in
numbers sufficient to have the minutest effect upon the
quality of the race.</p>

<p>The man of sub-normal intelligence, of bad nervous organization,
of specific defect even, can, in most modern communities
keep alive by his own efforts. He will drag on,
abysmally incompetent, indolent, badly behaved or ill. He
may irregularly rent a shelter which other men would refuse,
he will inevitably do his little bit to demoralize the
labor market and the work he from time to time takes up
and he may, for one reason or another, go for awhile to
prison. His demands on the almshouse we will omit as it
would probably in this connection count as social work. He
can do our work badly, put the cost of his keep on the community
if he goes to prison, make our pockets or our persons
unsafe, if he happens to be that way inclined, spread
disease and even, for a consideration, vote. What is to be
gained by leaving this poor creature to his own devices and
the haphazard propagation of his species? From a biological
point of view, nothing at all, and his running amuck is
a nuisance and a menace. What could social work do?
From a biological point of view, also nothing. If indeed
the man were so far defective that it could confine him to
an institution it might in that way prevent his leaving a
family but this simple precaution the biological critics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
would probably arrange for through some other agency.
But social work might greatly limit his troublesomeness.</p>

<p>One can only conclude that those who advocate leaving
the unfit to their own destruction do not know, as social
work knows, how slow that destruction is going to be, how
costly and troublesome to the community in which it is
taking place, how many people may be, first and last, involved
in it and, above all, how little likely it is to culminate
before the unfit man has left children to succeed
him.</p>

<p>Such glaring cases of unfitness are however not typical
of the sort with which social work most often deals. More
typical is such mild cherishing of unfitness as the securing
of eye-glasses for a nearsighted child. Would it do
any good to leave him without glasses, unable to see the
blackboard at school, considered a blockhead, unhappy and
defiant and growing up at odds with the world? He would
be no whit less likely to have a family of shortsighted
children.</p>

<p>Since the relative security of civilized life allows the unfit,
left to their own devices, to live long enough to demoralize
their community and perpetuate their strain, a
humane guardianship supplied by social work, with an eye
to prevention and all the possibilities of the social situation,
is simply the safeguarding of a group in which spontaneous
elimination has ceased to be sufficiently expeditious for the
public safety.</p>

<p>The last of those who would say “hands off” believe that
the needs to which social work at present ministers are
chargeable to a few major abuses in our economic system
which could and would be removed by swift revolutionary
measures were it not for false hopes of gradual reform—hopes
which social work helps to keep alive. They think
that if the distress caused by “the present system” were
left unrelieved people would be shocked into summary abolition
of the system. The chances of concerted action on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
any such program are so infinitesimal that it is difficult to
regard such a proposal as anything but a mere “talking
point” of propaganda. The abuses of the “present system”
are too hideously great for us to risk any momentary discontinuance
of their relief without a very certain guarantee
of the desired results.</p>

<p>And when it comes to that we can but remember that
the blackest nights of human oppression have not led to
the brightest mornings of human brotherhood, though
there has been many a fine gesture of uprising. What
Mr. Wells remarks in his “Outline of History” apropos of
the results of the French Revolution seems to be true of
any attempt to emancipate life at a blow. “When these
things of the ancient regime had vanished, it seemed as if
they had never mattered. * * * the immense promise and
air of a new world with which the Revolution had come
remained unfulfilled.</p>

<p>“Yet, after all, this wave of revolution had realized
nearly everything that had been clearly thought out before
it. It was not failing for want of impetus but for want
of finished ideas. Many things that had oppressed mankind
were swept away forever. Now that they were
swept away it became apparent how unprepared men were
for the creative opportunities this clearance gave them.
And periods of revolution are periods of action; in them
men reap the harvest of ideas that have grown during
phases of interlude, and they leave the fields cleared for
a season of new growth, but they cannot suddenly produce
ripened new ideas to meet an unanticipated riddle.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
Despite the years of thinking that have elapsed since 1789,
the Russian revolution finds itself in the same case. The
present party that has attempted its clean sweep of previous
organization is rich in coherence and intention but not
in organization and expedients.</p>

<p>Much of what social work is now doing is developing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>expedients of social practice equally applicable and equally
necessary under any form of government. The question
of whether social work as such should occupy itself with
the development of such expedients or with revolutionary
projects belongs not with the discussion of its overdoing,
but of its doing too little. The advocates of revolution say
“hands off” but they really despise social work for
temporizing.</p>

<p>To those who charge it with temporizing, the third and
last group of its critics, social work listens very gravely.
They touch it where its conscience is tender. The first
group, those who charge it with unworthy patronage and
intrusion do not touch its principle at all. It knows better
than any one else the sort of thing that may easily be done
in its name, knows that its recruits are unregenerate
human beings who will have to learn to put aside personal
for scientific curiosity and resist their enormous temptations
to tyrannize. It knows that the things for which
that first group condemns it are things which will always
continue to menace it but things which, on the whole, it
is growing away from. The second group, those who
charge it with interfering with natural selection and wasting
opportunity on lame ducks do not shake its conviction.
It knows perfectly well that not social work but the abundance
of mere food and shelter and the ingrained sympathy
or solidarity, or what you will, of civilized man is what
prevents the elimination of the unfit and that these unfit
can only be made innocuous and self-supporting by methods
and arrangements worked out by the intelligence of the
especially fit.</p>

<p>But when this third group tell social work that it is not
extending benefits but in the long run delaying their extension,
when they tell it that there is a dragon “privilege”
which can grow new heads of offence faster than it can
cut them off, when they say that social work must be either
utterly entangled in its own red tape or corrupted by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
flesh pots of Egypt not to see that it is simply compounding
with the mammon of unrighteousness to allow the continuance
of privilege and abuse, then indeed social work itself
is troubled. It has known all along that those are wrong
who say it is a mistake to serve the disadvantaged, but to
be told that it—social work—is not serving them, that is
a very different matter. The charges are two, first that
it is selfish and pharisaical, and second that it is practically
bought for the defense of privilege. The first complain of</p>

<p>Social work is confessed by the definition, to be “cautious”
and “statistical.” Used in this opprobrious sense the words
make a reproach that could scarcely be more bitter, but who
would want a doctor to pour out without stint the strichnia
needed by his patient’s heart? The development of
methods, standards and technique has been referred to in
these pages as matter only for congratulation. But obviously
these have their dangers like everything else. Our
childish humanity has been tempted, from the days of the
medicine man on, rather to claim the confidence of a gullible
public by the impressiveness of its ceremonies than
arduously to achieve that confidence by the excellence of
its performance. The temptation to aim at an impression
is especially strong in the case of social work because it
often does for people the sort of things that friends are
at the same time sporadically attempting. When with every
intention of producing efficiency social work tries to establish
“standards” it again has to risk the shift of emphasis
from the work to the technical measurement and the resulting
tendency to attempt what can be put through in
good form instead of what most needs to be done.</p>

<p>But the greatest resentment is probably not caused by
these lapses, which social workers themselves know better
than outsiders. “Organized charity” did not, as it is so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>easy for those who know only the present to assume, originate
suspicious scrutiny. Charity was “cautious” in the
sense of the bitter couplet long before the present organized
charity movement. The fierce old English poor law took
no chances on “impostors”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and the dread of them by the
private charities of the continent in the sixteenth century
has already been referred to in these pages. It is, of
course, easy to see the necessity for “investigation” when
charity is on a large scale. But it is easier to resent for
oneself, or one’s friends, the mortification of being suspect;
and to many people “organized charity” has never meant
anything more than an attempt to prevent overlapping and
imposture. But in the scientific charity movement precaution
soon sank into insignificance beside the more positive
purpose of learning enough about a situation to tackle
it intelligently. This is a trifle harder to understand and
even easier to resent. When we want help we usually have
a pretty definite notion of just what help we need, we are
in a touchy mood to begin with, and unless we are very nice
people indeed we resent any questioning of our preference.
It is a matter of common knowledge that those who do not
appreciate the difficulty of the doctor’s task and the time
required for cures drift from one dispensary to another
and try physician after physician in search of one who will
treat their troubles as they think they should be treated
and give them the relief for which suffering dares not
cease to hope. What wonder if a yet greater dissatisfaction
is felt with the deliberateness of the social worker.
And if, as we have said in the definition, he is to proceed
by “scientific” methods he must be as “cautious” and
“statistical” as the doctor.</p>

<p>But granting the need of caution in procedure it is
shocking and repellant, on the face of it, that this organized
charity should make the throbbing woes of a fellow creature
the subject of dehumanized records. It is bad enough that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>people should be required to strip their predicament bare,
exhibit all their helplessness and violate reticence to expound
whatever can “throw light on the situation”—but
why must it be recorded? But it is shocking enough to
learn that someone we care for is known as a certain sort
of case in a hospital and yet we have now so far appreciated
medical exigencies as to accept it as a necessity. In other
matters also we may come to realize that there is no impertinence
in impersonal treatment for purposes of serviceable
classification, and for all classification the prerequisite
is records.</p>

<p>A final source of misunderstanding is the double nature
of the social worker’s task. Not only in relief work but
in other lines as well he is not free to do as he would, he
cannot always command the means. He can decide what
he thinks would best be done but then he has to consider
what sort of approximation to that best the resources of
his association or community allow. The Webbs, in outlining
a proposed reorganization of the English relief system,
say that “Nothing has contributed so much to make
the visits of the Poor Law Relieving Officer odious as the
<i>mixture</i> of his inquiries—as to the sickness of the person
who is ill, or the lunacy of the person of unsound mind, and
at the same time, as to the means of the family and as to
what relations could be made to contribute.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This
stewardship for public or contributed funds and for doing
things quite irrelevant to any intention of social work do
more than anything else to make it seem “scrimped.”</p>

<p>Social work, then, may take heart of grace. It is, once
again, being condemned chiefly on misunderstanding and
for the rest on its mere shortcomings. All human undertakings
must expect that and try to amend and carry on.</p>

<p>It may summon its courage and meet the last charge,
the one that seems to make it most uncomfortable, a
charge that not only says it bails the sea with a sieve and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>locks the door when the horse is out of the stable, but goes
farther and ascribes motives—“the social worker is called
an apologist for the status quo; he is called a little brother
of the rich; he is accused of taking tainted money;”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>—and
why? Because social work continues in what its critics
consider “remedial” work instead of addressing itself to
wholesale and summary prevention.</p>

<p>Whose fault is that? Let any one who blames it on
social work turn to the reports of the national conference.
Let him turn to the “Survey.” He will find no lack of interest
in prevention. The fact is that social work is paid
for by voluntary subscriptions, philanthropic foundations,
and state appropriations. So far all these sources of support,
the potential representatives of the people in the
legislature no less than wealthy donors, are more accessible
to an appeal for relief of existing misery than to an appeal
for the prevention of possible catastrophes. This ties the
hands of social work even in the simple matters in which
it might alone do more “preventive work.” But social work
cannot alone, in any but a secondary sense, prevent the
situations it is called upon to relieve. It works prevention
as hard as it can and puts it up to the community in plain
terms, but the situations which, at our present stage of
progress, largely occupy its services could only be prevented
by a living wage and regular employment, work that
would not poison or exhaust the worker, sanitary and decent
housing, clean milk, and so on through the list of those
simple requisites of a civilized life which are now inaccessible
to a large part of our population. Social work cannot
give employers the will or the ability to pay a living wage;
it cannot provide the masses with decent housing and unadulterated
food nor, all at once, with a corresponding standard
and habit of living. And if it should stop all it is doing
now, in order to devote itself to prevention, neglected children
would grow up unhealthy and vicious, the feeble-minded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>would multiply and every calamity of today become
a fruitful source of multiplied disaster tomorrow. One
might as well ask that all physicians cease treating from
day to day the many diseases that afflict us, the better to
devote themselves to a wholesale campaign of prevention.
The social work of our definition has its own specific work
to do from day to day. It must, like medicine, care for the
handicapped in each generation and prevent the spread of
contagion while it uses the margin of its energies for prevention
and progress.</p>

<p>Social work <i>as we have described it</i>, is not synonymous
with social reform. It has no more responsibility for reform
on “general principles” than has any other profession
or calling. That it should ever be thought to have is a
tribute to its thoroughness and convincing proof of its
devotion to prevention.</p>

<p>We are told, as though to settle the case against social
work, that there are even social workers “who, while they
may not say it publicly, do not hesitate to say privately
that they regard social work as a mere “palliative,” and
while they get their living from it, their real hopes are
pinned to the coming social revolution.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The personal immorality
of anyone who would continue to get a living from a
calling he believed to be sailing under false colors is not
our business, but, if social work is what our definition says,
there is no reason why any social worker need hesitate to
say, either privately or with all the publicity he can command,
that his hopes are pinned to the coming social revolution,
or to the effects of New Thought or the Seventh
Day Advent or anything else to which he may have happened,
according to his lights and temperament, to have
pinned them.</p>

<p>Social work attempts to serve persons in need of help;
it shepherds the rear of the social procession; it cares for
the casualties; it also claims opportunity for the unprivileged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>and asserts the rights of the individual lost in the
mass. In so doing it finds itself effecting progress in the
many ways already discussed. They are usually indirect
ways. These critics assume that it could induce progress
directly by an attempt to bring about radical social changes
that would do away with the need for its services. They
quote against it Tolstoy’s indictment of our social system—“The
present position we, the educated and well-to-do
classes, occupy is that of the Old Man of the Sea, riding
on the poor man’s back, only, unlike the Old Man of the
Sea, we are sorry for the poor man, very sorry. And we
will do almost anything for the poor man’s relief; we will
not only supply him with food sufficient for him to keep
on his legs, but will provide him with cooling draughts concocted
on strictly scientific principles; we will teach and
instruct him and point out to him the beauties of the landscape;
we will discourse sweet music to him and give him
lots of good advice. Yes we will do almost anything for
the poor man, anything but get off his back.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Such a picture makes everyone unhappy to reflect on and
in face of it thoughtful social workers take stock of their
position. But they can only conclude that to accuse social
work per se of insincerity and temporizing, of clinging to
a snug berth, because it does not attempt to end this intolerable
situation by revolution is to imagine it both
greater and less than it is. We have already seen that it
is only a calling like others with a day’s work of its own.
Reforms merely free it from old duties and open the gates
to new ones and there is no reason to suppose that changes
the most radical would do away with the need of it or the
human impulse that perpetually recreates it. Whether
revolutionary methods would free us from present abuses
and confront us with a new set but, as it were, upon a
higher level, is, of course an open question and a relevant
one. But it is a question of pure expediency facing the
social worker of each generation as it faces anyone else and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>it in no way involves the integrity or the permanency of
the function of social work.</p>

<p>The alternatives in the interest of which social work
is by these critics condemned are the labor movement and
social revolution. But these are hardly genuine alternatives.
Both of them have the allegiance of people in many
callings, but each provides a day’s work to a comparatively
small number of organizers and other workers. There is
no logical reason why a social worker should not be active
in the service of either or both and yet remain in his calling,
as the bricklayer, lawyer, or laborer may.</p>

<p>The labor movement and social revolution and social work
are three things of three entirely different kinds. The
labor movement is a tide in human affairs. It is the projection
in practical issues of certain interpretations and
ideals of life. Social revolution is a cataclysmic expedient
for precipitating, in finished form, readjustments which
the labor movement and certain other influences tend
gradually and adaptively to effect. The one is a great
movement now under way, the other a vast enterprise or
a vast dream. For them is spilt the martyr blood that is
the seed of every church militant. They throw down a
gauntlet; they raise a banner; they stir our hearts. But
why not let the social worker also plod on with a good conscience
and a hope for his labors.</p>

<p>Social work is a group of callings representing a certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>function of civilized society whatever form that society
may take. Its nearest analogy is educational work. Whatever
form society may assume education seems likely to retain
the functions of rendering available the experience and
conclusions of the past and developing the capacities of each
generation as it comes on. Similarly we can ascribe to
social work, under whatever system of society it may be
conducted, the functions of completing inadequacy, extending
benefits and rescuing the individual from the category.
In a community where no one was poor or out of work,
where abundance of pure food and decent housing were
available for all, where wholesome recreation was attainable
and attractive, and physical and mental hygiene as
much a matter of course as school attendance, the tasks of
the social worker would not be what they are now; they
would be changed beyond our imagining. But they might
still be present. In some distant sunny noonday of a
healthy happy world it may even be possible that the supernormal
will need rescue from victimizing by the mass.
Even today social work is concerned for the superior child
handicapped by a public school routine that forces him to
keep step with the average and the dull.</p>

<p>What is overlooked by those who fail to see this permanency
in social work is that it has a day’s work of its
own. Since its object is personal service, it tends to focus
in the present and since that personal service is primarily
the relief of need, it is relative to the standard of the times.
“Radicalism is not an absolute but a relative school of
thought. It stands for the things that the government is
not ready to do. Hence it is that no government is really
radical.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Social work is radical in the sense that it proffers
services that have not yet become duties. It is by the
same token that it is also relative and will, despite changes
in social organization, continue to relieve new needs, to extend
new benefits and to rescue individuals from newly-felt
forms of regimentation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>
<p>That social work, as a calling, does not make itself tributary
to any one social philosophy casts no suspicion on its
integrity. Nor is it strange that the majority of social
workers individually should continue to hold, on the subject
of revolution, the opinions of the majority of their
fellow citizens. That social workers should become so
much interested in their own methods of relief as to forget
the prime object of all their system, that they should become
so devoted to the success of particular undertakings
as to be unobservant of other and perhaps better attempts
to relieve needs is a reproach to the guilty persons but it
no more touches the principles and functions of social work
than similar faults of practitioners in other lines condition
the presumptive functions of their respective callings.
Were this a discussion of social work in practice it would
be necessary to consider the degree to which its practitioners
have realized its possibilities. But a study of the
nature and functions of social work such as this purports
to be would lose itself in confusion in any attempt to determine
precisely how far instances have run true to type.
The teaching offered by the schools and the interests reflected
in the National Conference prove beyond a doubt
the direction of its main stream.</p>

<p>The charge we have just been discussing is the last of
the major accusations commonly brought against social
work, and the definition we have been using has now been
shown to describe a social work that can meet its critics
squarely and retain a claim to a function of its own in social
economy and a certain character and integrity.</p>

<p>It is one of those human activities which are pursued,
as we say, for their own sake. It can be justified on utilitarian
grounds but the justification never amounts to more
than permission to follow our inclination untroubled. Yet,
unlike other such activities, unlike recreation, art and learning,
it does not reach out to life at its happiest and most
conscious, its fullest and finest, but seeks, “Rather the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
scorned—the rejected—the men hemmed in by the spears.”
Social work lifts burdens, fills needs, extends benefits.</p>

<p>Social work is interested in all people that need help and
classifies them according to their needs, with no ulterior
interest. It tries to serve them in their individual capacity
as human beings with lives of their own. It is always
extending benefits in excess of any recognized obligation.
These we have heretofore said were the habits of charity,
using the word in a broad and primitive sense. When
charity adopted a scientific method and took to studying
the social sciences for light on its problems social work
began. Although it has been necessary to refer to charity
often and at length in establishing the nature of social
work, it is not well to dwell on it in general discussion,
because, first, it has lately been applied only to the relief
of poverty and cannot be used in a wider sense without
explanation and, secondly, through centuries of association
with an idea of meritorious liberality towards persons inferior,
it has acquired connotations which do not belong to
social work.</p>

<p>Social work as we now have it makes use of modern science.
From the social sciences it takes perspective,
generalization and knowledge of the complication of influences
responsible for any given situation. By statistical
methods it relates cause and effect. The discovery of such
a relationship always emphasizes causes and in consequence
social work extends its protective function in the direction
of prevention. By so doing it becomes not only a minister
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>to misery but also one of the forces operating to make the
world a better dwelling place for all of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Social work because it is tentative and experimental
seems to be imperfectly developed and still on trial. There
is a temptation to anticipate for it more certainty, more
obvious consistency and more clearly formulated purposes
when it shall have become better established. But any
such anticipation fails to take account of its wholly relative
nature. Social work is always feeling its way beyond
clearly formulated obligations, ignoring imposed consistencies
and groping in unexplored regions where sure-footedness
is not possible. Social work will take many more
forms and all of them will prove temporary.</p>

<p>This makes social work hard to compare with the established
professions with the ministrations of which its services
have many points in common, with medicine for example.
Although several sciences are helpful to social
work it specializes in the application of no one of them.
It is only in the very loosest sense applied sociology and
might with almost equal suggestiveness be called applied
eugenics or social psychology or any one of half a dozen
other things. Conversely its observations and experiences
are valuable to a dozen arts and sciences but build no science
of their own. Nor does it build any systematically
cumulative body of principles exclusively for its own use,
as does the law. This is no disgrace to social work, which
may be equally respectable with the well established professions
and yet quite <i>sui generis</i>. But it operates in indirect
ways as a handicap.</p>

<p>It is a familiar observation that any new science, any
new departure in human knowledge must use the vocabulary
already available and so can only receive its first formulation
in terms of things that have gone before. The
failure of social work to produce any compact body of doctrine
pertaining to its range of undertakings has kept it
long in the stage of analogy and tutelage. It evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
feels a temptation to shape itself after the fashion of the
best respected types of human activity instead of simply
envisaging its own objects as clearly as possible and enlisting
every available means to attain them.</p>

<p>Its essential inability to develop any compact body of
doctrine may also be handicapping it in a more fundamental
way. It is said that social work does not get its proportionate
share of the best students taking professional
training. May not this be because a course which offers
an acquaintance with the high lights of half a dozen subjects
and mastery of none is not likely to recommend itself
to able students as promising to lead to dignified and responsible
work? Social work can only hope that when more
time and more ability have gone into the development of
its separate fields such discipline may be developed along
special lines as will give it better intellectual status and the
power to attract and hold recruits by something beside that
appeal to their imagination or their humanity exerted by its
general possibilities. “I treat philanthropy seriously,”
wrote one of its historians, “because of what it implies; its
professors have commonly not been very efficacious.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
But scientific social work is something more than philanthropy
and its history is yet to be made.</p>

<p>Whatever is in store for social work it is pre-ordained
that its functions can only persist by adaptive variation of
its practices, that it will never be perfected, never be satisfied,
never even, in any final and completed sense, successful.
Its object is to correct the mistakes of nature and man in
the making of human lives and its undertakings grow with
our hopes for life. Such presumption can never succeed,
but its mere instalments of success would be triumphs in
a lesser enterprise. For social work each new triumph
opens only a new range of possibilities. It might well take
as its motto the proud words of Masefield, “Success is the
brand on the forehead for having aimed too low.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p class="hanging-indent1"><b>Edward T. Devine in “Social Work”</b> says (p. 21): “Social
work, then is the sum of all the efforts made by society
to ‘take up its own slack’ to provide for individuals
when its established institutions fail them, to supplement
those established institutions and to modify them
at those points at which they have proved to be badly
adapted to social needs. * * * It may be well done
or badly done; according to the most enlightened system
which intelligence and experience and sympathy
and vision can devise or according to the archaic
methods of careless and lazy emotion. * * * It includes
everything which is done by society for the
benefit of those who are not in position to compete on
fair terms with their fellows from whatever motive it
may be done, by whatever agency or whatever means
and with whatever results.”</p>

<p class="hanging-indent1"><b>Edward T. Devine and Lilian Brant in “American Social
Work in the Twentieth Century”</b> say (the first words
of the book): “In the United States of America ‘social
work’ has come into use in recent years as a comprehensive
term, including charity and philanthropy, public
relief, punishment and reformation and all other
conscious efforts, whether by the state or on private
initiative, to provide for the dependent, the sick, and
the criminal, to diminish the amount of poverty, disease,
and crime, and to improve general living and
working conditions.”</p>

<p class="indent">
These statements obviously are not trying to distinguish between
“social work” and the more primitive forms of “charity”
and “philanthropy.”
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hanging-indent1">The pamphlet “<b>Social Work</b>,” issued by the American Association
of Social Workers in 1922 disclaims any intention
“to give an authoritative definition of these terms
(i.e., charity, philanthropy, and social service) or of
‘social work,’” but it does authoritatively indicate that
“social work as a profession” may have occasion to
differentiate itself from charity and philanthropy (pp.
3 and 4). “In discussing social work as a profession it
is necessary to clarify certain conceptions which are
popularly confused with it. As is the case with any
activity that has emerged into professional status and
differentiated itself from the kind of activity in which
any one of ordinary intelligence might participate,
social work must live down a variety of names and conceptions
which were common to it in its early and unprofessional
forms.” “So we come to the term ‘social
work’ for a connotation which at least has implicit implications
of a process requiring specialized knowledge
and skill sufficient to be called professional.” “It is
well also to point out here that emphasis must be
placed on ‘process’ as an aid to keeping in mind the
fact that not what is done, but how it is done, is what
constitutes the test of professional activity.”</p>

<p class="hanging-indent1"><b>“Education for Social Work,” by Jesse Frederick Steiner</b>
(University of Chicago Press, 1921) gives, as its first
chapter, a five-page statement of “The Nature of Social
Work” which does not lend itself to quotation
otherwise than <i>in toto</i>. It reports about the same
conclusions as this thesis, which was prepared before
Mr. Steiner’s study.</p>

<p class="hanging-indent1"><b>Porter R. Lee</b> speaking to the National Conference of Social
Work in 1915 (see Report p. 597) described three conceptions
of the social worker. First, “Any person is a
social worker if his work has conscious social purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
although his vocation may be any one of the historic
forms of human activity. The second conception includes
as social workers those who are engaged in so-called
preventive work, that is to say, those whose
efforts are directed towards social legislation, toward
the development of the social point of view in the general
public and toward readjustments in social institutions
and social habits. * * * social work in this sense
is not concerned with those who are disabled by adverse
conditions of life but with the adverse conditions.
The third conception of the social worker on the other
hand identifies him primarily with efforts on behalf of
the subnormal. To one holding this conception the
social worker is one who endeavors through case work
to reestablish disabled families and individuals in a
routine of normal life. This does not preclude interest
in social legislation and other forms of preventive
work, but these are not the first task of the social
worker. When social work as a generic term first
came into general use leaders in the work for dependent
families, neglected children, the defective, the
delinquent and the destitute sick comprised almost the
entire group to which it was applied.” In the 1920
Conference (see Report p. 466) Mr. Lee said: “The subject
matter of social work is the adjustment of men to
their environment. * * * The necessity for social
work arises because of the difficulties faced by men
in making this adjustment. These difficulties are
sometimes in the man and sometimes in the environment.
Some factors in the environment bear too
heavily upon all men, some bear too heavily upon a
smaller number. * * * A large part of social work
is conducted with the purpose of softening the effect
of environmental factors which bear with undue severity
upon all men. Another large part of social work
aims at the development of greater resourcefulness in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
all men in meeting environmental demands. The
greater part of social work, however, is at present devoted
to the development of a higher adjusting power
in those persons who are most handicapped by environment
or a modification of those particular environmental
factors which handicap them.”</p>

<p class="hanging-indent1"><b>Miss Mary E. Richmond in “What is Social Case Work?”</b>
(Russell Sage Foundation, N.Y., 1922) breaks up what
Mr. Lee calls “preventive work” into three parts (pp.
223, 224). “The other forms of social work all of
which interplay with case work, are three—group work,
social reform, and social research. Case work seeks
to effect better social relations by dealing with individuals
one by one or within the intimate group of the
family. But social work also achieves the same general
ends in these other ways. It includes a wide
variety of group activities—settlement work, recreational
work, club, neighborhood and local community
work—in which the individual, though still met face
to face, becomes one of a number. By a method different
from that employed in either case or group
work, though with the same end in view, social reform
seeks to improve conditions in the mass, chiefly
through social propaganda and social legislation.
Whether the immediate object be better housing, better
working conditions, better use of leisure, or a long
list of other objectives, the main purpose in these different
social reforms still is to advance the development
of our human kind by improving social relations.
Finally, social research with its precious freight of
original discovery in all the fields covered by social
work, has also the secondary task of assembling known
facts in order to reinterpret them for use in social reform,
in group work and in case work.”</p>
</div>

<p>A fair amount of searching has failed to reveal many
statements which do as much as the above toward defining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
social work in succinct and specific terms. One finds instead
descriptions which, while satisfactory enough for the
purposes for which each was intended, ascribe to it no
really distinctive character but rather present it in generalizations
equally true of other disinterested undertakings, or
by making it synonymous with applied sociology or applied
religion simply throw the burden of definition onto those
other terms leaving the matter as indefinite as before.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
